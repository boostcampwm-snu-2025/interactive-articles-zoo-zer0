This study compared the effects of cold water immersion (CWI) and hot water immersion (HWI) on muscle recovery following a muscle-damaging exercise protocol in women. Thirty healthy women (23.3 ± 2.9 years) were randomly assigned to either the CWI, HWI, or control (CON) groups. Participants completed a standardised exercise protocol (5 x 20 drop-jumps), followed by a 10 min recovery intervention (CWI, HWI, or CON) immediately and 120 min post-exercise. Physiological responses, including muscle oxygen saturation (SmO2), core and skin temperature, and heart rate, were assessed at baseline, immediately post-exercise, after the first recovery intervention (postInt), and during 30 min follow-up. Recovery was evaluated through maximal voluntary isometric contraction, muscle swelling, muscle soreness ratings, and serum creatine kinase at baseline, 24, 48, and 72 h post-exercise. A mixed-effects model was used to account for repeated measures over time. Results showed lower SmO2 values in the CWI compared to the HWI group at 20 min (Δ-6.76%, CI: −0.27 to −13.25, p = 0.038) and 30 min (Δ-9.86%, CI: −3.37 to −16.35, p = 0.001), and compared to CON at 30 min (Δ-7.28%, CI: −13.77 to −0.79, p = 0.022). Core temperature was significantly higher in the HWI than the CWI group (postInt and 30 min), while it was significantly lower in the CWI group than CON (30 min). CWI caused a substantial decrease in skin temperature compared to HWI and CON between postInt and 30 min follow-up (all p < 0.001). Skin temperature was higher in the HWI group compared to CON at postInt and throughout 30 min follow-up (all p < 0.001). No significant differences in recovery markers were observed between CWI and HWI groups, although HWI led to slightly higher creatine kinase levels (24 h and 72 h) and greater muscle swelling (24 h) compared to CON. Despite distinct acute physiological responses to CWI and HWI, neither improved subjective or objective recovery outcomes during the 72 h follow-up compared to CON in women following a muscle-damaging exercise protocol.

Cold-water immersion (CWI) has become a widely adopted method for post-exercise 
recovery. However, its effectiveness in restoring neuromuscular function remains 
inconclusive. This study examined the impact of CWI on recovery following 
high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE). Twelve young, recreationally active 
individuals (10 males, 2 females) participated in a randomized crossover study. 
Each session included six sets of 30-s all-out isokinetic concentric 
contractions of the ankle dorsiflexor and plantar flexor muscles, followed by 
10 min of room temperature rest (RT) or CWI at 10°C. Neuromuscular function and 
intramuscular temperature were evaluated periodically over 24 h, as well as 
next-day fatigue resistance of the dorsiflexors. In both conditions, maximal 
voluntary contraction torque remained impaired for up to 3 h without significant 
changes in voluntary activation (p > 0.05). Electrically stimulated torque 
showed no difference in the fatigue-induced decline or recovery of 10 Hz torque, 
which also remained impaired for up to 3 h. However, 50 Hz torque recovered 
within 1 h following RT, whereas it remained slightly reduced for up to 3 h 
following CWI. The 10:50 Hz torque ratio showed immediate recovery with CWI, 
whereas RT recovery was delayed for up to 1 h. Notably, the ratio was 
significantly lower with RT at 0-, 0.5-, and 1-h post-intervention. Despite 
these differences, HIIE performance during a repeat bout conducted 24 h later 
remained similar. In conclusion, 10 min of CWI at 10°C does not enhance 
post-exercise recovery or next-day exercise performance following HIIE.

INTRODUCTION: Cold-water immersion is a popular method typically used to reduce 
exercise induced muscle damage and improve health and wellbeing. Despite these 
benefits, there is emerging evidence to suggest the temperature of the water 
exposure can influence energy intake in the subsequent hours. The study aim was 
to investigate the influence of water temperature on energy expenditure and 
post-water immersion ad-libitum energy intake in resting adults. Participants 
with a range of body masses, but otherwise healthy and physically active males 
(n = 10) and females (n = 5), participated in three randomised trials in a 
repeated measures crossover design, with a minimum of 7-days apart. Participants 
were immersed to sternum level for 30-minutes in either cold-water (16 °C), 
thermoneutral-water (35 °C) or a no-water thermoneutral ambient air control (26 
°C). Participants completed appetite related visual analogue scales throughout 
and were presented with an ad-libitum homogenous pasta meal and asked to eat 
until 'comfortably full'.
RESULTS: Repeated measures ANOVA showed participants consumed more energy after 
immersion in cold-water (2783 ± 909 kJ) versus both thermoneutral-water (1817 ± 
862 kJ) and thermoneutral ambient air (1894 ± 233 kJ). There were no differences 
in any of the appetite VAS. Core temperature remained stable throughout the 30 
min immersion period across trials, however an after-drop in core temperature 
was observed for 15 mins following cold-water immersion when compared to both 
thermoneutral water (P < 0.001), and thermoneutral air (P = 0.004). Although the 
exact mechanisms are yet to be elucidated, further research is required to 
identify if the after-drop in core temperature is a potential mechanism 
responsible for compensatory food intake post cold-water immersion.
CONCLUSION: When presented with an ad-libitum meal directly after cold-water 
immersion, participants consumed more in comparison to both thermoneutral water 
immersion and thermoneutral ambient air. With cold water immersion becoming 
popular, these findings have practical and clinical relevance for individuals' 
conscious about body mass management.

This study investigated the effect of five consecutive days of cold-water 
immersion (CWI) on recovery from exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) in the 
hamstrings following maximal eccentric contraction (EC) exercise. Eighteen 
healthy adult women were randomly assigned to a CWI group and a control group 
(CG) (n = 9/group). Participants performed 10 sets of 10 repetitions of 
isokinetic EC at 30°/second and underwent maximum voluntary isometric 
contraction (MVC), delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) assessment, straight leg 
raise (SLR) test, and plasma myoglobin (Mb) measurement. The CWI group received 
one 14-min session of CWI treatment (14°C) at 1, 25, 49, 73, and 97 h after the 
EC test, whereas the CG rested in a seated position at the same five time points 
without receiving treatment. (1) All the dependent variables in the CWI group 
and CG exhibited significant changes after the EC test (p < 0.05). (2) The 
recovery effect in the CWI group was significantly greater than in the CG in 
terms of the MVC, DOMS, SLR, and plasma Mb concentration results. MVC increased 
by 89.3 ± 2.0% on the fourth day (p < 0.013), DOMS decreased by 15.4 ± 1.5 mm on 
the second day (p < 0.000), SLR increased by 86.3 ± 1.1% on the second day 
(p < 0.014), and plasma Mb decreased by 436.3 ± 60.8% on the third day 
(p < 0.014). The study indicates that five consecutive days of CWI at 14°C 
significantly enhance recovery from exercise-induced muscle damage in the 
hamstrings.

INTRODUCTION: This study was designed to evaluate the effects of multiple 
cold-water immersions performed daily during the preseason period on 
biochemical, clinical, and neuromuscular aspects of muscle damage of soccer 
players.
METHODS: This two-arm, prospectively registered, randomized controlled trial, 
blinded to statistician and assessors, was conducted at professional football 
club facilities. Twenty-three under-20 semi-professionals male soccer players 
were randomly allocated into cold water immersion group (bathtub with water and 
ice at 10 °C ± 1 °C for 10 min) or control group (rest for 10 min), every day, 
after training sessions during a preseason. Primary outcome was change in 
creatine kinase (CK) concentration, and secondary outcomes were changes in 
vertical jump performance, strength and perception of recovery at baseline (T0) 
and after protocol training (T1).
RESULTS: Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) showed a statistically significant 
time-group interactions for CK concentration, with an average reduction of 
280.39 U/L (CI95% = -519.14, -41.64; d = 0.55) in the cold-water immersion 
compared to the control group. No differences between groups were observed in 
any other measures.
CONCLUSION: Multiple cold-water immersions at 10 °C for 10 min decreases CK 
concentration but does not change any clinical and neuromuscular markers of 
muscle damage in soccer players during a 9-day preseason.

Conditioned pain modulation and exercise-induced hypoalgesia reflect inhibitory 
pain controls emanating from the brain. The aim of this study was to compare the 
extent of pain inhibition from exercise-induced hypoalgesia (isometric wall 
squat), conditioned pain modulation (cold-water immersion), and their 
combination (wall squat followed by cold water in fixed order) in healthy 
pain-free adults. Sixty-one participants (median age 21 years) completed 3 
sessions (wall-squat, cold-water, and combined) in random order. Sessions were 
separated by at least a week. In each session, pressure-pain thresholds, 
single-pinprick-pain ratings, and pinprick-temporal summation of pain (the fifth 
minus the first) were obtained at quadriceps, forearms, and forehead, before and 
after wall squat and/or cold water. Each intervention inhibited pain to pressure 
(partial η2 = .26) and single pinprick (partial η2 = .16) to a similar extent; 
however, pressure-pain inhibition was negligible in the forehead. After 
adjusting for age and sex, single-pinprick-pain inhibition in the forehead 
induced by wall squat was associated with that induced by cold water (adjusted 
R2 = .15; P = .007), and stronger pain inhibition was predicted by a higher 
thigh-pain rating to wall squat (adjusted R2 = .10; P = .027). Neither 
intervention affected pinprick-temporal summation of pain. Together, the 
findings suggest that pain-inhibitory effects of exercise-induced hypoalgesia 
and conditioned pain modulation may overlap when exercise is at least moderately 
painful (6/10 intensity). Pressure pain in body regions remote from the 
exercised or conditioned sites may be weakly modulated. PERSPECTIVE: The current 
findings suggest that pain-inhibitory effects induced by painful wall squat and 
by cold-water immersion may overlap. The magnitude of pain inhibition in the 
forehead remote from the exercised thigh or the conditioned foot appears 
smaller, which could be examined further in future research.

Foot immersion and neck cooling are recommended cooling strategies for 
protecting heat-vulnerable persons during heat waves. While we recently showed 
that these strategies do not limit core temperature increases in older adults 
during prolonged heat exposure, we did observe small reductions in heart rate. 
Expanding on these findings, we examined the effects of foot immersion with and 
without neck cooling on cardiac autonomic function. Seventeen adults (9 females; 
65-81 years) underwent 3 randomized, 6 h exposures to 38 °C and 35% relative 
humidity with: no cooling (control), foot immersion (20 °C water), or foot 
immersion with a wet towel (20 °C) around the neck. Cardiac autonomic responses 
were measured at baseline and end-exposure. These included heart rate 
variability, cardiac and systolic blood pressure responses to standing, indexed 
via the 30:15 ratio and supine-to-standing systolic pressure change, 
respectively, and baroreflex sensitivity during repeated sit-to-stand maneuvers. 
The 30:15 ratio was 0.04 [95% CI: 0.01, 0.07] greater with foot immersion and 
neck cooling (1.08 (SD: 0.04)) relative to control (1.04 (0.06); P = 0.018). 
Similarly, standing systolic blood pressure was elevated 9 [0, 17] mmHg with 
foot immersion and neck cooling (P = 0.043). That said, neither difference 
remained statistically significant after adjusting for multiplicity 
(Padjusted ≥ 0.054). No differences in 30:15 ratio or standing systolic blood 
pressure were observed with foot immersion alone, while heart rate variability 
and baroreflex sensitivity were unaffected by either cooling intervention. While 
foot immersion with neck cooling potentially improved cardiac autonomic 
responses in older adults exposed to simulated indoor overheating, these effects 
were small and of questionable clinical importance.

PURPOSE: In recent years, there has been significant advancement in the 
guidelines for recovery protocols involving heat or cold water immersion. 
However, comparison between the effects of hot and cold water immersion on key 
markers of neuromuscular recovery following exercise-induced muscle damage 
(EIMD) is lacking.
METHODS: Thirty physically active males completed an individualized and tailored 
EIMD protocol immediately followed by one of the following recovery 
interventions: cold water immersion (11°C, CWI 11 ), hot water immersion (41°C, 
HWI 41 ), or warm-bath control (36°C, CON 36 ). Gastrointestinal temperature was 
tracked throughout HWI 41 . Knee extensors' maximal isokinetic strength (peak 
torque ( Tpeak )) and explosive strength (late-phase rate of force development 
(RFD 100-200 )) were measured before EIMD (pre-), 24 h (post-24 h), and 48 h 
(post-48 h) post-EIMD. In addition, pressure pain threshold (PPT) was measured 
to quantify the recovery from muscle soreness. Surface electromyography signals 
(sEMG) from the vastus lateralis were captured to extract the rates of 
electromyography rise (REMGR) and the spectral power in the low-frequency band.
RESULTS: At post-48 h, Tpeak returned to baseline values following both CWI 11 
(-8.3% ± 6.8%, P = 0.079) and HWI 41 (-1.4% ± 4.1%, P = 1). In contrast, RFD 
100-200 (-2.3% ± 29.3%, P = 1) and PPT (+5.6% ± 14.6%, P = 1) returned to 
baseline values at post-48 h only following HWI 41 . Spectral analysis of the 
sEMG signal revealed that the low-frequency band was significantly increased 
following CWI 11 (+9.0% ± 0.52%, P = 0.012). REMGR was unchanged regardless of 
the condition (all P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: A single session of HWI 41 , rather than CWI 11 , improved the 
recovery of the late-phase rate of force development following EIMD in 
physically active males. This suggests that in athletic contexts where a rapid 
force development is a key performance determinant, hot bath should be preferred 
over cold bath.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of alternating hot-cold water immersion 
(AHCWI) in patients with acute stroke.
DESIGN: A single-blind pilot randomized controlled trial.
SETTING: Department of Rehabilitation Medicine of a medical center.
PARTICIPANTS: Early stroke survivors (N=24) with moderate-to-severe arm paresis.
INTERVENTIONS: In addition to conventional rehabilitation, eligible patients 
were randomly assigned to an AHCWI group (n=12, for AHCWI) or a control group 
(n=12, for upper limb [UL] cycling exercises) 5 times per week for 6 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Fugl-Meyer Assessment motor-UL (FMA-UL) score, 
Motricity Index-UL (MI-UL) score, modified Motor Assessment Scale (MMAS; 
including its UL sections, MMAS-UL) score, Berg Balance Scale score, Barthel 
Index (BI), and modified Ashworth Scale score were assessed by the same 
uninvolved physical therapist at baseline and after 4 and 6 weeks of 
intervention.
RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the AHCWI group performed better, with 
significant group effects (P<.05), and exhibited significant improvements in 
FMA-UL, MI-UL, and MMAS-UL scores at 4 and 6 weeks (P<.05). Although the 
remaining outcomes were not significantly different, they favored the AHCWI 
group. Notably, a significant difference was observed in the BI at 4 weeks 
(P=.032). Significant changes in the muscle tone or adverse effects were not 
observed in either group after the intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: AHCWI with stroke rehabilitation is feasible and may facilitate 
motor function recovery of the paretic UL after a stroke.

Acute moderate normobaric hypoxia does not modify circulating thyroid hormone 
concentrations induced by 1 h of head-out cold-water immersion.

This study tested the hypothesis that acute moderate normobaric hypoxia augments 
circulating thyroid hormone concentrations during and following 1 h of cold 
head-out water immersion (HOWI), compared with when cold HOWI is completed 
during normobaric normoxia. In a randomized crossover single-blind design, 12 
healthy adults (27 ± 2 yr, 2 women) completed 1 h of cold (22.0 ± 0.1°C) HOWI 
breathing either normobaric normoxia ([Formula: see text] = 0.21) or normobaric 
hypoxia ([Formula: see text] = 0.14). Free and total thyroxine (T3) and 
triiodothyronine (T4), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations were 
measured in venous blood samples obtained before (baseline), during (15-, 30-, 
and 60 min), and 15 min following HOWI (post-), and were corrected for changes 
in plasma volume. Arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation and core (rectal) 
temperature were measured continuously. Arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation was 
lower during hypoxia (90 ± 3%) compared with normoxia (98 ± 1%, P < 0.001). Core 
temperature fell from baseline (normoxia: 37.2 ± 0.4°C, hypoxia: 37.2 ± 0.4°C) 
to post-cold HOWI (normoxia: 36.4 ± 0.5°C, hypoxia: 36.3 ± 0.5°C, P < 0.001) in 
both conditions but did not change differently between conditions (condition × 
time: P = 0.552). Circulating TSH, total T3, free T4, total T3, and free T4 
concentrations demonstrated significant main effects of time (all P ≤ 0.024), 
but these changes did not differ between normoxic and hypoxic conditions 
(condition × time: all P ≥ 0.163). These data indicate that acute moderate 
normobaric hypoxia does not modify the circulating thyroid hormone response 
during 1 h of cold HOWI.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Acute head-out cold (22°C) water 
immersion (HOWI) decreased core temperature and increased thermogenesis. This 
thermogenic response was paralleled by the activation of the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, as evidenced by changes in thyroid 
hormones. However, cold HOWI in combination with moderate normobaric hypoxia did 
not modify the thermogenic nor the circulating thyroid hormone response. This 
finding suggests that hypoxia-induced alterations in thyroid hormone 
concentrations are unlikely to acutely contribute to adaptations resulting from 
repeated cold-water exposures.

PURPOSE: Uncertainty exists if post-resistance exercise hydrotherapy attenuates 
chronic inflammatory and hormone responses. The effects of repeated 
post-resistance exercise water immersion on inflammatory and hormone responses 
in athletes were investigated.
METHODS: Male, academy Super Rugby players (n = 18, 19.9 ± 1.5 y, 1.85 ± 0.06 m, 
98.3 ± 10.7 kg) participated in a 12-week programme divided into 3  ×  4-week 
blocks of post-resistance exercise water immersion (either, no immersion control 
[CON]; cold [CWI]; or hot [HWI] water immersion), utilising a randomised 
cross-over pre-post design. Fasted, morning blood measures were collected prior 
to commencement of first intervention block, and every fourth week thereafter. 
Linear mixed-effects models were used to analyse main (treatment, time) and 
interaction effects.
RESULTS: Repeated CWI (p = 0.025, g = 0.05) and HWI (p < 0.001, g = 0.62) 
reduced creatine kinase (CK), compared to CON. HWI decreased (p = 0.013, 
g = 0.59) interleukin (IL)-1ra, compared to CON. HWI increased (p < 0.001-0.026, 
g = 0.06-0.17) growth factors (PDGF-BB, IGF-1), compared to CON and CWI. CWI 
increased (p = 0.004, g = 0.46) heat shock protein-72 (HSP-72), compared to HWI.
CONCLUSION: Post-resistance exercise CWI or HWI resulted in trivial and moderate 
reductions in CK, respectively, which may be partly due to hydrostatic effects 
of water immersion. Post-resistance exercise HWI moderately decreased IL-1ra, 
which may be associated with post-resistance exercise skeletal muscle 
inflammation influencing chronic resistance exercise adaptive responses. 
Following post-resistance exercise water immersion, CWI increased HSP-72 
suggesting a thermoregulatory response indicating improved adaptive inflammatory 
responses to temperature changes, while HWI increased growth factors (PDGF-BB, 
IGF-1) indicating different systematic signalling pathway activation. Our data 
supports the continued use of post-resistance exercise water immersion recovery 
strategies of any temperature during in-season competition phases for improved 
inflammatory adaptive responses in athletes.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects of repeated use of cold-water immersion (CWI) 
during a training week on performance and perceptive outcomes in competitive 
adolescent swimmers.
METHODS: This randomized-crossover study included 20 athletes, who received each 
intervention [CWI (14 ± 1 °C), thermoneutral water immersion (TWI) (27 ± 1 °C) 
as placebo, and passive recovery (PAS)] three times a week between the 
land-based resistance training and swim training. The interventions were 
performed in a randomized order with a 1-week wash-out period. We tested 
athletes before and after each intervention week regarding swim (100 m freestyle 
sprints) and functional performance (flexibility, upper and lower body power, 
and shoulder proprioception). We monitored athlete's perceptions (well-being, 
heaviness, tiredness, discomfort and pain) during testing sessions using a 
5-item questionnaire. Athlete preferences regarding the interventions were 
assessed at the end of the study. We used generalized linear mixed models and 
generalized estimating equations for continuous and categorical variables, 
respectively (intervention x time).
RESULTS: We found a time effect for swim performance (p = .01) in which, 
regardless the intervention, all athletes improved sprint time at 
post-intervention compared to baseline. There was an intervention effect for 
pain (p = .04) and tiredness (p = .04), but with no significant post-hoc 
comparisons. We found no significant effects for other outcomes. All athletes 
reported a preference for CWI or TWI in relation to PAS.
CONCLUSION: The repeated use of CWI throughout a training week did not impact 
functional or swim performance outcomes of competitive adolescent swimmers. 
Perceptive outcomes were also similar across interventions; however, athletes 
indicated a preference for both CWI and TWI.

This study compared the acute effects of three recovery methods: active recovery 
(AR), hot- and cold-water immersion (HWI and CWI, respectively), used between 
two training sessions in elite athletes. Twelve national-team skaters (7 males, 
5 females) completed three trials according to a randomized cross-over study. 
Fifteen minutes after an exhaustive ice-skating training session, participants 
underwent 20 min of HWI (41.1 ± 0.5°C), 15 min of CWI (12.1 ± 0.7°C) or 15 min 
of active recovery (AR). After 1 h 30 min of the first exercise, they performed 
a repeated-sprint cycling session. Average power output was slightly but 
significantly higher for AR (767 ± 179 W) and HWI (766 ± 170 W) compared to CWI 
(738 ± 156 W) (p = 0.026, d = 0.18). No statistical difference was observed 
between the conditions for both lactatemia and rating of perceived exertion. 
Furthermore, no significant effect of recovery was observed on the fatigue index 
calculated from the repeated sprint cycling exercises (p > 0.05). Finally, a 
positive correlation was found between the average muscle temperature measured 
during the recoveries and the maximal power output obtained during cycling 
exercises. In conclusion, the use of CWI in between high-intensity training 
sessions could slightly impair the performance outcomes compared to AR and HWI. 
However, studies with larger samples are needed to confirm these results, 
especially in less trained athletes.

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether brief cold exposure can 
reverse fasting-induced glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, and improve 
resting energy expenditure (REE). Twelve young non-obese women were randomly 
assigned to undergo the following conditions: 2 days of fasting with two 10-min 
whole-body cold-water immersions on separate days (FAST-COLD), 2 days of fasting 
without cold-water immersions (FAST), 2 days of usual diet with two 10-min 
whole-body cold-water immersions on separate days (COLD), or 2 days of usual 
diet without cold-water immersions (CON) in a randomised crossover fashion. 
Changes in REE and substrate utilisation, and glucose tolerance and insulin 
sensitivity from the oral glucose tolerance test were examined. The results 
showed that FAST-COLD and FAST trials increased (P < 0.05) REE and decreased 
(P < 0.05) respiratory quotient, but these variables did not differ 
significantly between the FAST-COLD and FAST trials. The glucose and insulin 
area under the curves (AUCs) were higher (P < 0.05) in the FAST-COLD and FAST 
trials than in the CON and COLD trials, and these AUCs were lower (P < 0.05) in 
the FAST-COLD than in the FAST trial. Matsuda index was lower in the FAST trial 
than in the CON trial (P < 0.05), and tended to be greater after the FAST-COLD 
trial than after the FAST trial (P = 0.060). In conclusion, cold exposure had no 
effect on REE but decreased fasting-induced glucose intolerance which was 
accompanied by a maintained insulin sensitivity.

PURPOSE: The study aimed to investigate the effect of repeated cold-water 
immersion (CWI) after high-intensity interval exercise sessions on 
cardiac-autonomic modulation, neuromuscular performance, muscle damage markers, 
and session internal load.
METHODS: Twenty-one participants underwent five sessions of high-intensity 
interval exercise (6-7 bouts of 2 min; pause of 2 min) over a two-week period. 
Participants were allocated randomly into either a group that underwent CWI 
(11-min; 11 °C) or a group that performed passive recovery after each exercise 
session. Before the exercise sessions were performed, countermovement jump (CMJ) 
and heart rate variability were recorded (i.e., rMSSD, low and high frequency 
power and its ratio, SD1 and SD2). Exercise heart rate was calculated by 
recording the area under the curve (AUC) response. Internal session load was 
evaluated 30 min after each session. Blood concentrations of creatine kinase and 
lactate dehydrogenase were analyzed before the first visit and 24 h after the 
last sessions.
RESULTS: The CWI group presented higher rMSSD than the control group at each 
time point (group-effect P = 0.037). The SD1 was higher in CWI group when 
compared to the control group following the last exercise session (interaction 
P = 0.038). SD2 was higher in CWI group compared to the control group at each 
time point (group-effect P = 0.030). Both groups presented equal CMJ performance 
(P > 0.05), internal load (group-effect P = 0.702; interaction P = 0.062), heart 
rate AUC (group-effect P = 0.169; interaction P = 0.663), and creatine kinase 
and lactate dehydrogenase blood concentrations (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Repeated post-exercise CWI improves cardiac-autonomic modulation. 
However, no differences in neuromuscular performance, muscle damage markers, or 
session internal load were demonstrated between the groups.

The efficacy of a multimodal recovery strategy implemented after a 
high-intensity rugby league training session. J Strength Cond Res 37(8): 
1634-1642, 2023-The efficacy of a multimodal recovery strategy implemented 
within 4 hours of rugby league (RL) training was investigated using 
repeated-measures, randomized, crossover methods in 10 professional academy RL 
players (age: 17 ± 1 years). Following standardized training (5,383 m covered, 
350-m high-speed running, 28 repeated high-intensity efforts, 24 collisions), 
players completed a multimodal recovery (REC) strategy (i.e., ∼640 kcal meal + 
∼1,285 kcal snacks or drinks, cold-water immersion, sleep hygiene 
recommendations) or control (i.e., ∼640 kcal meal: CONT) practices. Isometric 
mid-thigh pulls (IMTP), countermovement jumps (CMJ), and wellness questionnaires 
were completed before (-3 hours) and after (+24, +48 hours) training. The 
recovery strategy influenced IMTP peak force ( p = 0.026), but between-trial 
differences were undetectable. No other between-trial effects (all p > 0.05) 
were seen for IMTP, CMJ, or wellness variables. Training-induced reductions in 
CMJ peak power (-4 ± 6% vs baseline: 4,878 ± 642 W) at +24 hours ( p = 0.016) 
dissipated by +48 hours. Fatigue and lower-body soreness reduced by 16 ± 19% ( p 
= 0.01) and 32 ± 44% ( p = 0.024) at +48 hours versus +24 hours, respectively. 
Relative to CONT (i.e., posttraining nutrition), the effects of a single bout of 
recovery practices appeared limited when implemented after RL-specific training. 
Therefore, when training included limited collisions, balanced postexercise 
meals appeared equally effective relative to a multimodal recovery strategy. 
Transient changes in performance and wellness variables after training may have 
implications for practitioners. Consecutive training sessions, including a high 
frequency and intensity of eccentric muscle actions, should be carefully 
planned, especially near match-play.

Marine Survival in the Mediterranean: A Pilot Study on the Cognitive and 
Cardiorespiratory Response to Sudden Cool Water Immersion.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: The Mediterranean is one of the major gateways of human 
migratory fluxes from Northern Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia to 
Europe. Sea accidents have become an urgent humanitarian crisis due to the high 
number of migrants on the move, but data on the physiological effects to sudden 
cool water immersion are not as extensive as cold-water studies. We wanted to 
evaluate to what extent cool water immersion (~18 °C) may detrimentally affect 
cognitive ability and cardiorespiratory strain compared to the more prevalent 
cold-water (<10-15 °C) studies.
METHODS: In this case, 10 active, healthy men participated in this study which 
consisted of completing one familiarization trial, and then a control (CON) or 
experimental (EXP) trial in a randomized, repeated-measures, cross-over fashion, 
separated by at least 7-days. Cognitive function was assessed via the Symbol 
Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), a code substitution test, performed at baseline, 
then repeated in either a thermoneutral (~25 °C room air) dry environment, or 
when immersed to the neck in 18 °C water. Testing consisted of six ""Step"" 
time-blocks 45-s each, with a 5-s pause between each Step. Cardiorespiratory 
measures, continuously recorded, included heart rate (beats per minute), minute 
ventilation (V˙E, L∙min-1), oxygen consumption (V˙O2, L∙min-1), and respiratory 
frequency (fR, count∙min-1).
RESULTS: Initial responses to cool water (<2 min) found that participants 
performed ~11% worse on the code substitution test (p = 0.025), consumed 149% 
greater amounts of oxygen (CI: 5.1 to 9.1 L∙min-1, p < 0.0001) and experienced 
higher cardiovascular strain (HR CI: 13 to 38 beats per minute, p = 0.001) than 
during the control trial. Physiological strain was in-line to those observed in 
much colder water temperature.
CONCLUSION: Sudden, cool water immersion also negatively affects cognitive 
function and cardiorespiratory strain, especially during the first two minutes 
of exposure. The magnitude increase in heart rate is strongly associated with 
poorer cognitive function, even in (relatively) warmer water consistent with 
temperatures found in the Mediterranean Sea environment.

Background: Gout arthritis is an autoinflammatory arthritis that generates 
chronic long-term pain. Pain impacts physical activities, joint mobility, 
stress, anxiety, depression, and quality of life. Cold-water immersion therapy 
reduces inflammation and pain associated with gout arthritis. However, 
cold-water immersion therapy has not been conducted among people worldwide with 
gout arthritis. Objective: To investigate the cold-water immersion intervention 
on pain, joint mobility, physical activity, stress, anxiety, depression, and 
quality of life among acute gout patients. Methods: A community-based randomized 
control trial design with two parallel-intervention groups: a cold-water 
immersion group (20-30°C 20 minutes/day for 4 weeks) and a control group. In 
total, 76 eligible participants in Tomohon City, Indonesia, were recruited using 
a multi-stage sampling method and were randomly assigned using block 
randomization. A generalized estimating equation model was used to analyze the 
results (coef. β) and produce 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A path analysis 
was used to analyze mediating effects. Results: Significant pain alleviation (β 
= -2.06; -2.42), improved joint mobility (β = 1.20, 1.44), physical activity (β 
= 2.05, .59), stress (β = -1.25; -1.35), anxiety (β = -.62; -1.37), and quality 
of life (β = 5.34; 9.93) were detected after cold-water immersion at the 
second-week, and were maintained to the fourth-week time point, compared to 
pre-intervention and the control group. Depression (β = -1.80) had decreased by 
the fourth week compared to the pre-test and control group. Cold-water immersion 
directly mediated alleviation of pain (β = -.46, p ≤ .001) and to promote the 
quality of life (β = .16, p = .01). Conclusions: Cold-water immersion decreased 
pain, stress, anxiety, and depression, and increased joint mobility, physical 
activity, and quality of life. It mediated alleviation of pain to increase the 
quality of life.

The aim of this study was to compare the immediate effects of cold-water 
immersion (CWI) and hot-water immersion (HWI) versus passive resting after a 
fatigue-induced bout of exercise on the muscle contractile properties of the 
Vastus Medialis (VM). We conducted a randomised cross-over study involving 28 
healthy active men where muscle contractile properties of the VM wer recorded 
using Tensiomyography (TMG) before and after CWI, HWI or passive resting and up 
to one-hour post-application. The main outcomes obtained were muscle 
displacement and velocity of deformation according to limb size (Dmr and Vdr). 
Our results showed a significant effect of time (F(3.9,405) =32.439; p <0.001; 
η2p =0.29) and the interaction between time and temperature (F(7.9,405) =5.814; 
p <0.001; η2p=0.13) on Dmr but no for temperature alone (F(2,81) =2.013; p 
=0.14; η2p=0.04) while for Vdr, both time (F(5.2,486) =23.068; p <0.001 
η2p = 0.22) and temperature (F(2,81) =4.219; p = 0.018; η2p= 0.09) as well as 
the interaction (F(10.4,486) =7.784; p <0.001; η2p =0.16) were found 
significant. Compared to CWI, HWI increased Dmr post-application and Vdr both 
post-application as well as 15 and 45' thereafter. These findings suggest that 
applying HWI could be a valid alternative to CWI to promote muscle recovery.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of pre- and per-cooling interventions on 
subsequent 15-min time-trial (TT) cycling performance in the heat.
DESIGN: Randomized cross-over design.
METHODS: Nine male athletes completed four experimental trials in the heat 
(40 °C, 50% rh): no-cooling (CON); warm-up per-cooling (PER: neck-cooling collar 
applied during the preload); pre-cooling (PRE: 30 min of cold water (22 °C) 
immersion [CWI]); and pre- and per-cooling combined (PRE + PER). In each trial, 
participants completed a 45-min preload exercise (50% V̇O2peak), followed by a 
15-min TT. Physiological (rectal [Tre], skin [Tsk], and neck [Tneck] 
temperature, and heart rate [HR]) and perceptual data (ratings of perceived 
exertion [RPE], thermal comfort [TC] and thermal sensation [TS]) were measured 
throughout.
RESULTS: Tre and Tsk were lower in PRE and PRE + PER at the start of the preload 
(p < 0.001). Tre remained lower throughout the preload following CWI although 
these differences were no longer present at the start of the TT (p = 0.22). 
Tneck was lowered throughout in PER and PRE + PER (p < 0.001). No other 
physiological or perceptual differences were observed at the start or end of the 
preload or TT. Participants covered a similar TT distance in all trials 
(15.7-15.9 km, p = 0.77).
CONCLUSIONS: Pre-cooling induced thermoregulatory benefits for ~45 min and 
perceptual benefits for the same duration when supplemented with per-cooling. 
Neck per-cooling offered no such benefits when used in isolation. Neither pre- 
nor per-cooling, in isolation or combination, improved subsequent 15-min cycling 
time-trial performance in well-trained participants in the heat (40 °C).

Experience of cold-water immersion on recovery efficiency after soccer match.

Farkhari Babak M, Mosaferi Ziaaldini M, Hoseini Seyyed Reza A.

BACKGROUND: immersion in cold-water is one of the most common recovery and 
rehabilitation techniques among athletes. However, several factors such as 
shocking induced by cold water can affect the effectiveness of this technique.
AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of 4 weeks cold water 
habituation on the effectiveness of CWI recovery technique on muscle damage and 
function indices of young soccer players.
METHODS: Twenty young men with no previous experience of CWI participated in 
this study. Output power and RSADec of subjects were measured. The subjects then 
performed a simulated soccer test and, after collecting blood samples, were 
immediately immersed in 15 ° C water for 15 minutes. Twenty-four hours later 
blood sampling and functional tests were repeated. Subjects then were divided 
randomly into two groups of exercise with CWI recovery and exercise with passive 
recovery. After four weeks, the blood sampling and performance tests repeated 
like the pre-test.
RESULTS: The CWI had no significant effect on serum levels of AST and LDH before 
and after 4 weeks of CWI (P> 0.05). Also, there was no significant difference in 
power output and RSADec after CWI before and after cold water habituation (P> 
0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: It seems that the experience of recovering by immersion in 
cold-water has no effect on the effectiveness of this method. Therefore, soccer 
coaches and athletes should think more about using this recovery method.

INTRODUCTION : l'immersion en eau froide est l'une des techniques de 
récupération et de rééducation les plus courantes chez les athlètes. Cependant, 
plusieurs facteurs tels que le choc induit par l'eau froide peuvent affecter 
l'efficacité de cette technique.
OBJECTIF: Le but de cette étude était d'étudier l'effet de 4 semaines 
d'habituation à l'eau froide sur l'efficacité de la technique de récupération 
CWI sur les dommages musculaires et les indices fonctionnels des jeunes 
footballeurs.
MÉTHODES: Vingt jeunes hommes sans expérience préalable du CWI ont participé à 
cette étude. La puissance de sortie et le RSADec des sujets ont été mesurés. Les 
sujets ont ensuite effectué un test de football simulé et, après avoir recueilli 
des échantillons de sang, ont été immédiatement immergés dans de l'eau à 15° C 
pendant 15 minutes. Vingt-quatre heures plus tard, les prélèvements sanguins et 
les tests fonctionnels ont été répétés. Les sujets ont ensuite été divisés au 
hasard en deux groupes d'exercice avec récupération CWI et exercice avec 
récupération passive. Après quatre semaines, le prélèvement sanguin et les tests 
de performance se répètent comme le pré-test.
RÉSULTATS: Le CWI n'a eu aucun effet significatif sur les taux sériques d'AST et 
de LDH avant et après 4 semaines de CWI (P> 0,05). De plus, il n'y avait pas de 
différence significative entre la puissance de sortie et le RSADec après CWI 
avant et après l'accoutumance à l'eau froide (P> 0,05).
CONCLUSIONS: Il semble que l'expérience de récupération par immersion en eau 
froide n'ait aucun effet sur l'efficacité de cette méthode. Par conséquent, les 
entraîneurs de football et les athlètes devraient réfléchir davantage à 
l'utilisation de cette méthode de récupération.

A poor outcome of whole-body hypothermia often results from a late complication, 
rather than from acute effects of hypothermia. A low body (cell) temperature or 
the increase in the concentrations of the stress hormones cortisol, epinephrine, 
and norepinephrine in response to acute cold stress have been proposed as potent 
proinflammatory cytokine suppressant. In the current study, we tested the 
hypothesis that the recovery of body temperature from a whole-body intermittent 
cold-water immersion (CWI, at 13-14 °C for a total 170 min) is associated with a 
delayed response of proinflammatory cytokines in young healthy men. Our results 
revealed a delay in the increase in the proinflammatory interleukin 6 and 
interleukin 1β cytokines after the CWI, which paralleled the changes in 
cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and body temperature. CWI decreased tumor 
necrosis factor α (TNF-α) immediately and 1 h after the CWI. Although TNF-α had 
recovered to the pre-immersion level at 2 h after CWI, its natural circadian 
cycle kinetics was disrupted until 12 h after the CWI. Furthermore, we showed 
that CWI strongly modified the white blood cell counts, with changes reaching a 
peak between 1 and 2 h after the CWI.

Cold water immersion (CWI) purportedly reduces inflammation and improves muscle 
recovery after exercise, yet its effectiveness in specific contexts 
(ultraendurance) remains unclear. Thus, our aim was to study hematological 
profiles, systemic inflammation, and muscle damage responses to a specific 
post-race CWI (vs. control) during recovery after the Ironman World 
Championship, a culmination of ∼100 000 athletes competing in global qualifying 
Ironman events each year. Twenty-nine competitors were randomized into either a 
CWI or control (CON) group. Physiological parameters and blood samples were 
taken at pre-race, after intervention (POST), and 24 (+1DAY) and 48 hours 
(+2DAY) following the race. Muscle damage markers (plasma myoglobin, serum 
creatine kinase) were elevated at POST, +1DAY, and +2DAY, while inflammatory 
cytokines interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and IL-10 and total leukocyte counts were 
increased only at POST. CWI had no effect on these markers. Numbers of the most 
abundant circulating cell type, neutrophils, were elevated at POST more so in 
CWI (p < 0.05, vs. CON). Despite that neutrophil counts may be a sensitive 
marker to detect subtle effects, CWI does not affect recovery markers 24- and 
48-hours post-race (vs. CON). Overall, we determined that our short CWI protocol 
was not sufficient to improve recovery. Novelty: Ironman World Championship 
event increased circulating muscle damage markers, inflammatory markers, and 
hematological parameters, including circulating immune cell sub-populations that 
recover 24-48 hours after the race. 12-min CWI post-ultraendurance event affects 
the absolute numbers of neutrophils acutely, post-race (vs. CON), but does not 
impact recovery 24- and 48-hours post-race.

Effects of 2 Intersection Strategies for Physical Recovery in Jiu-Jitsu 
Athletes.

César EP, Júnior CSR, Francisco RN.

PURPOSE: To compare the effect of static stretching (SS) and cold-water 
immersion (CWI) on strength performance and blood lactate levels of jiu-jitsu 
athletes.
METHODS: A total of 21 male Brazilian jiu-jitsu fighters were randomly assigned 
to SS (9 × 30-s carpal extension), CWI (3 × 3 min at 10°C), or a control group 
(CG); their maximal handgrip strength, handgrip muscle endurance, dynamic kimono 
grip strength test, and blood lactate concentration were assessed before and 
after a simulated Brazilian jiu-jitsu fight and after one of the recovery 
interventions.
RESULTS: There was an interaction (F = 9.075; P = .002) and a time effect (F = 
11.792; P = .003) for dynamic kimono grip strength test, showing a decrease in 
performance for the CG (P = .0001; effect size [ES] = 0.52, moderate) and after 
SS (P = .006; ES = 0.43, small). There was an interaction (F = 3.592; P = .015) 
and a time effect (F = 122.631; P = .0001) for blood lactate concentration, 
showing lower levels after CWI versus CG (P = .028; ES = 0.93, moderate) and 
after CWI versus SS (P = .042; ES = 0.82, moderate). There was an interaction (F 
= 9.617; P = .001) for handgrip strength, showing an impairment in performance 
after SS (P = .001; ES = 0.67, moderate).
CONCLUSION: CWI promoted restoration of muscle strength and endurance and 
reduction in blood lactate levels after the simulated fight and can thus be used 
by jiu-jitsu athletes as a recovery strategy between fights.

We investigated the acute effects of cold-water immersion (20°C) with higher CO2 
concentration (CCWI) following a high-intensity Wingate anaerobic exercise test 
(WAnT) on subjects' sublingual temperature (Tsub), blood lactate ([La]b), heart 
rate (HR), and aerobic cycling work efficiency (WE) compared to cold tap-water 
immersion (20°C; CWI) and passive recovery (PAS). Fifteen subjects completed 
three testing sessions at 1-week intervals. Each trial consisted of a first WE 
and WAnT, and a 20-min recovery intervention (randomized: CCWI, CWI, and PAS) 
before repeating a second WE and WAnT. The WE was measured by the metabolic 
demand during 50% V.O2max exercise. HR, Tsub, and [La]b were recorded throughout 
the testing sessions. There was a signiﬁcant decline in the WE from 1st bout to 
2nd bout at each recovery intervention. The WAnT was also significantly reduced 
at 2nd bout. Significantly reduced [La]b was achieved at CCWI compared to PAS, 
but not to the CWI. Likewise, the reduction in HR following immersion was the 
largest at CCWI compared to the other conditions. These ﬁndings indicate that 
CCWI is an effective intervention for maintaining repeated cycling work 
efficiency, which might be associated with reduced [La]b and HR.

PURPOSE: Cold-water immersion is increasingly used by athletes to support 
performance recovery. Recently, however, indications have emerged suggesting 
that the regular use of cold-water immersion might be detrimental to strength 
training adaptation.
METHODS: In a randomized crossover design, 11 participants performed two 8-week 
training periods including 3 leg training sessions per week, separated by an 
8-week ""wash out"" period. After each session, participants performed 10 minutes 
of either whole-body cold-water immersion (cooling) or passive sitting 
(control). Leg press 1-repetition maximum and countermovement jump performance 
were determined before (pre), after (post) and 3 weeks after (follow-up) both 
training periods. Before and after training periods, leg circumference and 
muscle thickness (vastus medialis) were measured.
RESULTS: No significant effects were found for strength or jump performance. 
Comparing training adaptations (pre vs post), small and negligible negative 
effects of cooling were found for 1-repetition maximum (g = 0.42; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], -0.42 to 1.26) and countermovement jump (g = 0.02; 95% CI, -0.82 
to 0.86). Comparing pre versus follow-up, moderate negative effects of cooling 
were found for 1-repetition maximum (g = 0.71; 95% CI, -0.30 to 1.72) and 
countermovement jump (g = 0.64; 95% CI, -0.36 to 1.64). A significant condition 
× time effect (P = .01, F = 10.00) and a large negative effect of cooling (g = 
1.20; 95% CI, -0.65 to 1.20) were observed for muscle thickness.
CONCLUSIONS: The present investigation suggests small negative effects of 
regular cooling on strength training adaptations.

To examine efficacy of cold water immersion (CWI) and massage as recovery 
techniques on joint position sense, balance, and fear of falling following 
exercise-induced muscle damage in older adults. Seventy-eight older men and 
women performed a single bout of strength training on the calf muscles (3 
exercises with 4 sets of 10 reps with 75% of 1RM) to induce muscle damage. After 
the damaging exercise, participants received either a 15-minute massage on calf 
muscles, or a CWI of the lower limb in cold water (15 ± 1°C) for 15 minute, or 
passive rest. Interventions were applied immediately after the exercise protocol 
and at 24, 48, and 72 hours post-exercise. Muscle pain, calf muscle strength, 
joint position sense, dynamic balance, postural sway, and fear of falling were 
measured at each time point. Repeated application of massage after EIMD relieved 
muscle pain, attenuated the loss of muscle strength and joint position senses, 
reduce balance impairments, and fear of falling in older adults (P ≤ .05). 
However, repeated applications of CWI, despite relieving muscle pain (P ≤ .05), 
did not attenuate the loss of muscle strength, joint position senses, balance 
impairments, and fear of falling. CWI had only some modest effects on muscle 
pain, but massage attenuated EIMD symptoms and the related impairments in muscle 
strength, joint position sense, balance, and postural sway in untrained older 
individuals. Therefore, older exercisers who plan to participate in strength 
training can benefit from massage for recovery from muscle damage indices and 
balance to decrease falling risk during the days following strength training.

Muscle contractile properties in clinical practice are often measured using 
either subjective scales or high-cost, inaccessible equipment. In this 
randomised cross-over study, we aimed to explore the use of tensiomyography 
(TMG) to assess changes in muscle contractile properties after cold- and 
warm-water immersion. The muscle contractile properties of the biceps femoris 
(BF) were assessed using TMG in 12 healthy active men (mean age 23 ± 3 years, 
Body Mass Index 22.9 ± 1.3 kg/m2) before and after a 20-min warm- or cold-water 
immersion over a period of 40 min. Muscle displacement (Dm) and contraction time 
(Tc) were registered as the main variables of the study. There was a significant 
condition by time interaction for Dm (p < 0.01). Post hoc analysis showed that, 
compared to the baseline, there was an increase in Dm 40 min after warm-water 
immersion (p < 0.01) and a decrease at 10 min after cold-water immersion (p < 
0.01). No significant effect was found for Tc. Our results indicate that muscle 
contractile properties are affected by water temperature and time after the 
immersion; therefore, these factors should be taken into account when 
water-immersion is used as a recovery strategy.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common sensory-motor 
disorder among the pregnant women. The aim of this study is to compare the 
impacts of two methods of immersion of legs in cold and warm water on the RLS 
symptoms among the pregnant women.
METHODS: This randomized clinical trial was conducted on 80 pregnant women with 
RLS who referred to Taleghani educational-therapy center. After obtaining their 
informed consent, they were selected by accessible method and randomly allocated 
into group 1 (warm water) and group 2 (cold water). Group 1 were asked to put 
their legs in cold water for 10 min every night for 2 weeks. The group 2 put 
their legs in warm water under the same condition. The severity of RLS was 
measured before and after the study. Data analysis was conducted using 
descriptive as well as the analytical statistics such as Chi-square, independent 
T test, pair T test, Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon and covariance.
RESULTS: After intervention, mean RLS of the cold water group was11.02 ± 4.93; 
while this mean was 13.50 ± 4.74 in the warm water group. The difference between 
the two groups was significant (p = 0.017). Results also revealed that the 
severity of RLS symptoms at the end of the treatment was different from the 
beginning of the research in both groups (p = 0.001). The intervention with both 
warm and cold water declined the RLS symptoms among pregnant women.
CONCLUSION: The warm and cold water can be used for this purpose depending on 
the women's preference. However, this article recommends the cold water for more 
reducing of symptoms.

The purpose of the present study was to assess the effect of different water 
immersion temperatures on handgrip performance and haemodynamic changes in the 
forearm flexors of males and females. Twenty-nine rock-climbers performed three 
repeated intermittent handgrip contractions to failure with 20 min recovery on 
three separate laboratory visits. For each visit, a randomly assigned recovery 
strategy was applied: cold water immersion (CWI) at 8 °C (CW8), 15 °C (CW15) or 
passive recovery (PAS). While handgrip performance significantly decreased in 
the subsequent trials for the PAS (p < 0.05), there was a significant increase 
in time to failure for the second and third trial for CW15 and in the second 
trial for CW8; males having greater performance improvement (44%) after CW15 
than females (26%). The results indicate that CW15 was a more tolerable and 
effective recovery strategy than CW8 and the same CWI protocol may lead to 
different recovery in males and females.

compares the effects of 2 common recovery interventions performed shortly after 
an exhausting interval running session on running economy (RE) and biomechanics. 
Forty-eight well-trained male runners performed an exhaustive interval running 
protocol and an incremental treadmill test 24 hours later at 3 speeds: 12, 14, 
and 16 km·h-1. Subjects randomly received either massage, cold water immersion 
(CWI), or passive rest (control). Runners repeated the treadmill test 48 hours 
after the first test. A two-way mixed analysis of variance was performed 
comparing groups and testing times. The massage group had significantly better 
recovery than the control group at 14 km·h-1 in RE (p < 0.05; η2 = 0.176) and 
greater stride height and angle changes at 16 km·h-1 (p < 0.05; η2 = 0.166 and p 
< 0.05; η2 = 0.208, respectively). No differences were observed between the CWI 
and control groups. The massage group had greater stride height and angle 
changes at 16 km·h-1 than the CWI group (p < 0.05; η2 = 0.139 and p < 0.05; η2 = 
0.168, respectively). Moreover, differences in magnitude suggested moderate 
effects on RE (η2 = 0.076) and swing time (η2 = 0.110). These results suggest 
that massage intervention promotes faster recovery of RE and running 
biomechanics than CWI or passive rest.

PURPOSE: This study examined the effects of daily post-exercise cold-water 
immersion (CWI) on match performance, perceptual recovery, and biomarkers of 
muscle damage and metabolic load during a 5-day international tournament of 
elite youth field-hockey players.
METHODS: The entire German under-18 national squad (n = 18) was randomly 
assigned to a daily CWI- (5-min at ~ 6 °C; excluding the head; n = 9) or passive 
recovery (CON; n = 9) intervention. Training and match performance were assessed 
using a GPS-tracking system and perceived exertion (RPE). Daily ratings of 
delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), perceived stress and recovery, quality of 
sleep, heart-rate recovery and serum creatine kinase (CK), lactate 
dehydrogenase, and urea nitrogen were also recorded. Repeated-sprint ability 
(RSA) and counter-movement jump (CMJ) were carried out on days 1 and 5.
RESULTS: There was no significance between intervention differences in time-on 
pitch, total distance, velocity zones, and accelerometer-base parameters during 
match performance (all p > 0.05). DOMS (p < 0.01), RPE (p < 0.01), and CK 
(p < 0.01) were significantly elevated over the course of the tournament; 
however, no between-intervention effects were observed (all p > 0.05). Both 
groups were able to maintain RSA and CMJ (all p > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, daily post-exercise CWI did not improve match 
performance, perceptual recovery, or biomarkers of muscle damage and metabolic 
load in elite youth field-hockey players.

This randomized controlled trial examined the effects of cold-water immersion 
(CWI), partial-body cryotherapy (PBC), or a passive control (CON) on 
physiological and recovery variables following exercise-induced muscle damage 
(EIMD, 5 × 20 drop jumps) in females. Twenty-eight females were allocated to PBC 
(30 seconds at -60°C, 2 minutes at -135°C), CWI (10 minutes at 10°C), or CON 
(10 minutes resting). Muscle oxygen saturation (SmO2 ), cutaneous vascular 
conductance (CVC), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and local skin temperature were 
assessed at baseline and through 60 minutes (10-minute intervals), while delayed 
onset of muscle soreness (DOMS), muscle swelling, maximum voluntary isometric 
contraction (MVIC), and vertical jump performance (VJP) were assessed up to 
72 hours (24-hour intervals) following treatments. SmO2 was lower in PBC 
(Δ-2.77 ± 13.08%) and CWI (Δ-5.91 ± 11.80%) compared with CON (Δ18.96 ± 1.46%) 
throughout the 60-minute follow-up period (P < .001). CVC was lower from PBC 
(92.7 ± 25.0%, 90.5 ± 23.4%) and CWI (90.3 ± 23.5%, 88.1 ± 22.9%) compared with 
CON (119.0 ± 5.1 and 116.1 ± 6.6%, respectively) between 20 and 30 minutes 
(P < .05). Mean skin temperature was lower from CWI vs PBC (between 10 and 
40 minutes, P < .05). Mean skin temperature was higher in CON compared with CWI 
up to 60 minutes and compared with PBC up to 30 minutes (P < .05). DOMS was 
lower following both PBC and CWI compared with CON through 72-hour (P < .05), 
with no difference between groups. No main group differences for swelling, MVIC, 
and VJP were observed. In conclusion, CWI elicited generally greater 
physiological effects compared with PBC while both interventions were more 
effective than CON in reducing DOMS in females, but had no effect on functional 
measures or swelling.

The use of strategies to assure better post-effort recovery is frequent in 
sports settings. There are several interventions available for exercise induced 
muscle damage recovery, but cold-water immersion (CWI) stands out among them. 
The effects of CWI are unclear in the literature and, although the number of 
street runners has been growing, there is a gap in the scientific evidence 
regarding the use of CWI to recover runners' performance after a 10-km street 
run. Purpose: The goal of our study was to analyze the effects of CWI on the 
recovery of muscle damage markers after a 10-km street run. Method: We randomly 
assigned thirty male recreational street runners, immediately after a 10-km 
street run, into three recovery groups: control (rest for 10 minutes), immersion 
(10 min immersed in water without ice at room temperature) and CWI (10 min 
immersed in water with ice at 10ºC). We assessed pain, triple hop distance, 
extensor peak torque and blood creatine kinase levels pre- and post-run, 
post-intervention and 24 hours after the run. Results: The 10-km run was enough 
to decrease triple hop distance and extensor peak torque, and increase levels of 
creatine kinase (p < 0.05); however, we found no time/group interactions in any 
of the assessed variables after we applied the appropriate interventions (p > 
0.05). Conclusion: 10-min CWI at 10°C was no more effective than water immersion 
and rest in recovering muscle damage markers after 10-km runs.

The current study compared cold-water immersion (CWI) and active recovery (AR) 
to static stretching (SS) on muscle recovery post-competitive soccer matches in 
elite youth players (n = 15). In a controlled crossover design, participants 
played a total of nine competitive soccer games, comprising three 80 minute 
games for each intervention (SS, CWI and AR). Muscle oedema, creatine kinase 
(CK), countermovement jump performance (CMJA) and perceived muscle soreness 
(PMS) were assessed pre-, immediately post-, and 48 hours post-match and 
compared across time-intervals and between interventions. Following SS, all 
markers of muscle damage remained significantly elevated (P < 0.05) compared to 
baseline at 48 hours post-match. Following AR and CWI, CMJA returned to baseline 
at 48 hours post-match, whilst CK returned to baseline following CWI at 48 hours 
post-match only. Analysis between recovery interventions revealed a significant 
improvement in PMS (P < 0.05) at 48 hours post-match when comparing AR and CWI 
to SS, with no significant differences between AR and CWI observed (P > 0.05). 
Analysis of %change for CK and CMJA revealed significant improvements for AR and 
CWI compared to SS. The present study indicated both AR and CWI are beneficial 
recovery interventions for elite young soccer players following competitive 
soccer matches, of which were superior to SS.

shower on recovery from high-intensity cycling in the heat. J Strength Cond Res 
33(8): 2233-2240, 2019-Post-exercise cooling, e.g., cold water immersion has 
shown beneficial cardiovascular and hormonal effects during recovery from 
exercise in a hot environment. However, not much is known about the effects of a 
cold water shower (CWS) as a recovery intervention. This study examined the 
effects of a CWS on heart rate (HR), core temperature (Tc), salivary cortisol, 
and thermal comfort sensation (TCS) after exercise in the heat. Nine healthy 
male subjects (age, 21 ± 1 year) performed 45 minutes of cycling in a hot 
environment (35° C, 40-60% relative humidity) at 65% of peak oxygen uptake. 
Thereafter, subjects underwent the CWS condition (15 minutes, 15° C water 
shower) or control (SIT25; 15 minutes passive recovery in 25° C room) in a 
randomized crossover design. After each 15 minutes, subjects sat in a 25° C room 
for another 2-hour recovery. Heart rate, Tc, and TCS were recorded before and 
immediately after exercise, immediately after CWS or SIT25, and at 30 minutes, 
1, and 2 hours during additional recovery. Salivary cortisol was collected at 
the same time points except at 30 minutes of the additional recovery period. 
Thermal comfort sensation was higher immediately after CWS (+4; very 
comfortable) than SIT25 (+1; just comfortable). The change of HR decreased 
faster with CWS (-18.3 ± 2.3%) than with SIT25 (-7.0 ± 4.6%) at the first 
30-minute recovery time point (p < 0.01). No differences between recovery 
conditions were observed for the Tc or salivary cortisol at any time point 
during the 2-hour recovery period. The findings demonstrate that a 15-minute, 
15° C CWS was not effective in reducing Tc or salivary cortisol during recovery 
from exercise in a hot environment. However, CWS can promote TCS by facilitating 
a faster HR recovery after 30-minute postintervention compared with passive 
recovery. The cooling benefits of a CWS could be only recommended to reduce 
cardiac stress after routine workout in a hot environment.

OBJECTIVES: We investigated if cold water immersion (CWI) affects exercise 
performance during a prolonged intermittent sprint test (IST), designed to mimic 
activity patterns of team-sports.
DESIGN: Randomized-crossover design.
METHODS: Ten male team-sport players completed 3 IST protocols (two 40-min 
""halves"" of repeated 2-min blocks consisting of a 8-s ""all-out"" sprint, 100-s 
active recovery and 12-s rest) on a cycle ergometer at normothermic conditions. 
Each ""half"" was separated by a 15 min recovery period of either: (i) passive 
rest, (ii) 5-min CWI at 8 °C (CWI-5) or (iii) 2.5-min CWI at 8 °C (CWI-2.5), in 
a random counterbalanced order.
RESULTS: Physical performance, core temperature (Tcore) and heart rate were not 
different among conditions in the first half. In the passive rest trial, total 
work (TW) and peak power (PP) were lower during the second half (TW: 
5.04 ± 1.11 kJ; PP: 929 ± 286 W) than the first half (TW: 5.66 ± 1.02 kJ; PP: 
1009 ± 266 W); while TW and PP were not different between halves following CWI-5 
(first half, TW: 5.34 ± 1.02 kJ, PP: 1016 ± 283 W; second half, TW: 
5.19 ± 1.38 kJ; PP: 996 ± 318 W) and CWI-2.5 (first half, TW: 5.47 ± 1.19 kJ, 
PP: 966 ± 261 W; second half, TW: 5.25 ± 1.17 kJ; PP: 952 ± 231 W). Tcore was 
lower until the 20th minute of the second half after CWI-5 and CWI-2.5 compared 
with passive rest.
CONCLUSIONS: A post-exercise 2.5-5-min CWI attenuates the reductions in 
prolonged sprint performance that occur in the second half of team sports, due, 
at least partly, to reductions in core temperature and associated increase in 
heat storage.

INTRODUCTION: Cold-water immersion (CWI) is often used to promote recovery by 
reducing exercise-induced muscle damage, soreness, and inflammation. However, 
recent reports have cautioned that CWI may attenuate the adaptive response to 
resistance training.
PURPOSE: To determine the effect of post resistance-exercise CWI on circulating 
free testosterone (T) and cytokine (IL-6 and TNF-α) response.
METHODS: Using a randomized and counterbalanced repeated-measures design, 11 
resistance-trained men completed two workouts (6 sets of 10 repetitions of back 
squats at 80% of maximum load) a week apart after which they took part in either 
15 min of CWI (15 °C) or passive recovery. T, IL-6, and TNFα were measured in 
blood samples taken before (PRE) and 5 (5POST), 15 (15POST), 30 (30POST), and 60 
(60POST) min post-exercise and compared between treatments and over time.
RESULTS: For T, a significant interaction effect of condition over time 
(p = 0.030) as well as greater relative concentrations of T in CON (Δ9.2%) than 
CWI (Δ-0.5%, p = 0.049) at 30POST were observed. In addition, at 60POST, T 
dropped below PRE values in CWI (Δ-10.4%, p = 0.028) but not in CON (Δ-1.6%, 
p = 0.850). A suppressed cytokine response was observed after CWI in IL-6 at 
30POST (CWI: Δ4.9%, CON: Δ47.5%, p = 0.041) and TNFα at 15POST (CWI: Δ5.3%, CON: 
Δ17.0%, p = 0.022).
CONCLUSIONS: CWI blunted the T and cytokine response after a bout of resistance 
exercise. These results indicate that CWI results in an altered anabolic 
response and may help to explain the previous observation of attenuated 
hypertrophy when CWI is used after resistance exercise.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the effects of cold water immersion 
(CWI) recovery strategies on the blood pressure levels and related physiological 
parameters after high-intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE).
METHODS: This randomized crossover study included 20 men (21.5±1.6 years). Each 
participant performed a maximum-exertion exercise performance test on a bicycle, 
and heart rate was measured. Subsequently, six cycles of HIIE (1 minute at 120% 
heart rate reserve [HRR] and 4 minutes at 40% HRR) were performed in a random 
sequence, and the recovery period involved either CWI or static rest (SR).
RESULTS: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels at the 6th and 20th minute 
of CWI recovery were significantly higher than those during SR and significantly 
higher than those during a quiet state at the 6th minute. The heart rates at the 
20th minute and 35th minute of CWI recovery were significantly lower than that 
during SR, and the ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) at the 6th and 20th 
minute of CWI recovery were significantly lower than that during SR. No 
significant difference in lactate production was evident between the two 
recovery strategies. Ear temperature was not significantly different when it was 
quiet, at the end of exercise, and at the 6th and 35th minute of recovery; 
however, at the 20th minute of recovery, ear temperature during CWI was 
significantly higher than that during SR.
CONCLUSIONS: CWI after HIIE reduced the extent to which blood pressure 
decreased. For the fatigue-related heart rate and RPE indicators, CWI was 
superior to SR.

We assessed the effects of post-exercise cold-water immersion (CWI) in 
modulating PGC-1α mRNA expression in response to exercise commenced with low 
muscle glycogen availability. In a randomized repeated-measures design, nine 
recreationally active males completed an acute two-legged high-intensity cycling 
protocol (8 × 5 min at 82.5% peak power output) followed by 10 min of two-legged 
post-exercise CWI (8°C) or control conditions (CON). During each trial, one limb 
commenced exercise with low (LOW: <300 mmol·kg-1 dw) or very low (VLOW: 
<150 mmol·kg-1 dw) pre-exercise glycogen concentration, achieved via completion 
of a one-legged glycogen depletion protocol undertaken the evening prior. 
Exercise increased (P < 0.05) PGC-1α mRNA at 3 h post-exercise. Very low muscle 
glycogen attenuated the increase in PGC-1α mRNA expression compared with the LOW 
limbs in both the control (CON VLOW ~3.6-fold vs. CON LOW ~5.6-fold: P = 0.023, 
ES 1.22 Large) and CWI conditions (CWI VLOW ~2.4-fold vs. CWI LOW ~8.0 fold: 
P = 0.019, ES 1.43 Large). Furthermore, PGC-1α mRNA expression in the CWI-LOW 
trial was not significantly different to the CON LOW limb (P = 0.281, ES 0.67 
Moderate). Data demonstrate that the previously reported effects of 
post-exercise CWI on PGC-1α mRNA expression (as regulated systemically via 
β-adrenergic mediated cell signaling) are offset in those conditions in which 
local stressors (i.e., high-intensity exercise and low muscle glycogen 
availability) have already sufficiently activated the AMPK-PGC-1α signaling 
axis. Additionally, data suggest that commencing exercise with very low muscle 
glycogen availability attenuates PGC-1α signaling.

PURPOSE: This study examined the independent effects of cold-water submersion 
and a rehydration strategy on an aerobic endurance performance and orthostatic 
tolerance following a four-hour dive in cold water (10°C).
METHODS: Nine male subjects completed a control (CON) performance and lower-body 
negative pressure test (LBNP) and two water immersion visits with either no 
rehydration (NR) or a post-immersion rehydration (RH) with 1 L of water. 
Following submersion, subjects ran to exhaustion and submitted to LBNP.
RESULTS: Core body temperature declined during submersion and remained reduced 
from baseline until the run (P ⟨ 0.001) and was not different between NR and RH 
(P = 0.13). Total urine output during submersion was not different between 
groups (1.69 ± 0.49 (NR), 1.75 ± 0.52 (RH) L; P = 0.74) eliciting a body mass 
reduction of -2.2 ± 0.3 and -0.8 ±; 0.3% (P ⟨ 0.01), respectively. Run duration 
was not different (547 ± 141 (NR), 566 ± 152 (RH) s; P = 0.79); however, both NR 
and RH run duration was shorter compared to CON (722 ± 170 s; P = 0.04). 
Cumulative stress index was suppressed in NR (534 ± 163 mmHg*min) and RH (591 ± 
129 mmHg*min) compared to CON (707 ± 170 mmHg*min, P V#8804; 0.03), with no 
differences between submersion trials (P = 0.23).
CONCLUSION: Compared to a non-submersed state, run duration and orthostatic 
tolerance was reduced following a four-hour cold-water submersion. Rehydration 
with 1 L of water following submersion did not offer a performance advantage 
over no rehydration.

BACKGROUND: Investigations of the perfusion of the skin's microcirculation with 
laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) after cold treatments are rare. Therefore, 
the aim of this study was to compare the effects between cold-water immersion 
(CWI) conduction and partial-body cryotherapy (PBC) convection on perfusion of 
the microcirculation and skin temperature on the thigh.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty healthy males were randomly allocated to CWI (10°C 
for 10 minutes) or PBC (-60°C for 30 seconds, -135°C for 2 minutes). Perfusion 
and skin temperature measurements were conducted on the anterior thigh region up 
to 60 minutes post-treatment.
RESULTS: Cold-water immersion decreased perfusion of the microcirculation 
significantly compared to baseline values between 10 minutes (P = 0.003) and 
30 minutes (P = 0.01) post-treatment. PBC increased perfusion of the 
microcirculation and decreased skin temperature only at the first measurement 
interval (0 minute, both P = 0.01) post-treatment. Additionally, local skin 
temperature was significantly decreased compared to baseline values only after 
CWI up to 30 minutes (P = 0.04) post-treatment.
CONCLUSION: Cold-water immersion reduced local skin microcirculation and skin 
temperature while PBC only slightly increased the perfusion of the 
microcirculation immediately after the treatment. For cooling purposes, the 
conduction method seems superior compared to the convection method, assessed 
with a LSCI device.

post-exercise recovery process and its applicability in a cold water immersion 
protocol. J Strength Cond Res 33(5): 1266-1275, 2019-The objective of this study 
was to propose a mathematical model to analyze the post-training recovery of 
perceptive, functional, metabolic, and autonomic parameters from the use of cold 
water immersion (CWI) through isolated and combined analysis. Following 
simulated training, 64 male soccer players were randomized into an experimental 
group (EG: CWI, 13 ± 1° C; 15 minutes) and a control group (CG: passive 
recovery; 15 minutes). Perceptive (soreness and perception of recovery), 
autonomic (heart rate variability [HRV]), metabolic (lactate concentration), and 
functional parameters (squat jump, T agility test, sprint test, 40-second test, 
and maximal voluntary isometric contraction) were analyzed before and at 
specific moments after training (without exceeding 2 hours after training). The 
variables were analyzed using the raw data, dichotomization of each variable 
(isolated analysis), and through a mathematical model using the combination of 
all parameters analyzed (combined analysis). The combined analysis did not 
demonstrate better efficacy of the EG compared with the CG (69.17 and 63.4%, p = 
0.09). In the isolated analysis, a chance of the technique being better was 
observed in the metabolic parameter at 1 and 2 hours after training (odds ratio, 
95% confidence interval = 3.75 [1.01-13.88] and 11.11 [1.25-98.49]), 
respectively, and in the autonomic parameter at 40-45 minutes after training 
(4.4 [1.09-17.67]). For the raw data, all parameters analyzed presented recovery 
by 2 hours after training for both groups. Based on the proposed mathematical 
model, it is concluded that CWI is not better than the control condition. 
However, considering the analysis of variables in isolation, the technique 
presents a better chance of recovery for blood lactate concentration and HRV.

The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of cold water immersion 
(CWI) after an intermittent test on the recovery kinetic of physical 
performance, muscle damage and perceived muscle soreness in professionals soccer 
players. In a randomized design, eight soccer players completed the Loughborough 
Intermittent Shuttle Test followed by 10 min of either CWI (10C°) or 
thermoneutral water immersion (TWI) (28C°). Physical performance (Squat jump: 
SJ, countermovement jump: CMJ, maximal voluntary contraction: MVC, and 20 m 
sprint: SP), muscle damage parameter (creatine kinase: CK) and perceived muscle 
soreness were assessed at baseline, 0 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h after the 
intermittent test. After the test, a decrease was observed in SJ and in CMJ at 
0 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h with TWI (p < 0.05) and only at 0 h for SJ with CWI 
(p < 0.05). SP decreased at 24 h and 48 h after the test with TWI (p < 0.05) and 
only at 24 h with CWI (p < 0.05). MVC, CK activity and perceived muscle soreness 
increased in both condition after the test and returned to baseline levels 72 h 
after the test with TWI (p < 0.05) and at 48 h with CWI (p < 0.05). For the 
correlation between physical performance and muscle damage parameters in CWI 
session, the statistical analysis didn't reveal any significant link between CK 
and SJ, CMJ, MVC or SP values (p > 0.05). The results suggest that CWI 
immediately after an intermittent test reduces muscle damage and perceived 
muscle soreness, and accelerate recovery of physical performance in professional 
soccer players. However, the faster recovery of physical performance seems not 
be related to the lower level of muscle damage induced by CWI.

PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of different recovery strategies on fatigue 
markers following a prolonged running exercise.
METHODS: 46 recreational male runners completed a half-marathon, followed by 
active recovery (ACT), cold water immersion (CWI), massage (MAS) or passive 
recovery (PAS). Countermovement jump height, muscle soreness and perceived 
recovery and stress were measured 24h before the half-marathon (pre), 
immediately after the recovery intervention (postrec) and 24h after the race 
(post24). In addition, muscle contractile properties and blood markers of 
fatigue were determined at pre and post24.
RESULTS: Magnitude-based inferences revealed substantial differences in the 
changes between the groups. At postrec, ACT was harmful to perceived recovery 
(ACT vs. PAS: effect size [ES] = -1.81) and serum concentration of creatine 
kinase (ACT vs. PAS: ES = 0.42), with CWI being harmful to jump performance (CWI 
vs. PAS: ES = -0.98). It was also beneficial for reducing muscle soreness (CWI 
vs. PAS: ES = -0.88) and improving perceived stress (CWI vs. PAS: ES = -0.64), 
with MAS being beneficial for reducing muscle soreness (MAS vs. PAS: ES = -0.52) 
and improving perceived recovery (MAS vs. PAS: ES = 1.00). At post24, both CWI 
and MAS were still beneficial for reducing muscle soreness (CWI vs. PAS: ES = 
1.49; MAS vs. PAS: ES = 1.12), with ACT being harmful to perceived recovery (ACT 
vs. PAS: ES = -0.68), serum concentration of creatine kinase (ACT vs. PAS: ES = 
0.84) and free-testosterone (ACT vs. PAS: ES = -0.91).
CONCLUSIONS: In recreational runners, a half-marathon results in fatigue 
symptoms lasting at least 24h. To restore subjective fatigue measures, the 
authors recommend CWI and MAS, as these recovery strategies are more effective 
than PAS, with ACT being even disadvantageous. However, runners must be aware 
that neither the use of ACT nor CWI or MAS had any beneficial effect on 
objective fatigue markers.

Effects of cold water immersion on aerobic capacity and muscle strength of young 
footballers.

Boujezza H, Sghaier A, Ben Rejeb M, Gargouri I, Latiri I, Ben Saad H.

AIMS: The main aim was to compare aerobic performance data, determined before 
«period1» and after «period2» cold water immersion in two groups of footballers 
(CWI and no-CWI groups).
METHODS: This is an experimental study with matching and randomization. The 20 
male footballers, aged 17 to 20 years, were divided into two groups (n = 10 for 
each) following a random draw. The two groups were age-, height- and weight 
matched. 1000-m race was made during the two periods. Heart-rate (HR, % of 
theoretical maximum HR) and hemoglobin oxygen saturation (Oxy-sat, %) were 
measured before and after the race, and the time of the race (min) was noted. An 
Oxy-sat decrease > 4 points retained the diagnosis of exercise-induced 
desaturation. Eight CWI sessions (one per week), until the hip in a standing 
position (10 min; temperature: 11-12 °C) were performed.
RESULTS: The two groups were age-, height- and weight matched. Comparatively to 
the race time of «period1», this of «period2» was decreased in the CWI group 
(3.21±0.04 vs. 3.15±0.04 min) and was increased in the no-CWI group (3.23±0.05 
vs. 3.27±0.07 min). Comparatively to the HRs (before, after the race) of 
«period1», these of «period2» were decreased in the CWI group (36±1 vs. 34±1%; 
56±3 vs. 44±2%) and were increased in the no-CWI group (35±2 vs. 36±1%; 55±2 vs. 
57±2%). Comparatively to the after race Oxy-sat' of the «period1», this of 
«period2» was increased in the CWI group (96±1 vs. 98±0%) and was decreased in 
the no-CWI group (96±1 vs. 95±1%). While in the CWI group, the percent of 
desaturators was decreased between «period1» and «period2» (30 vs. 0%), in the 
no-CWI group, percentages remained similar (50 vs. 90%).
CONCLUSION: CWI improves aerobic capacity and muscle strength of young 
footballers.

We investigated the effect of postmatch cold-water immersion (CWI) on markers of 
muscle damage, neuromuscular fatigue, and perceptual responses within 72 h after 
a rugby match. Twenty-two professional male rugby players were randomized into 
CWI (10 °C/10 min; n = 11) or control (CON: 30 min seated; n = 11) groups. 
Activity profile from Global Positioning Satellite systems and postmatch rating 
of perceived exertion were measured to determined match load. Biochemical (tumor 
necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6), neuromuscular performance (squat 
(SJ) and countermovement jumps (CMJ), peak power output (PPO), rate of force 
development (RFD), stiffness, 10- and 30-m sprint time, and perceptual markers 
(soreness, perceived recovery) were obtained before and immediately after the 
match, and then at 30 min, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after the match. Magnitude-based 
inference and Cohen's effect size (ES) were used to analyze change over time and 
between groups. Thus, the higher/beneficial, similar/trivial, or lower/harmful 
differences were evaluated as follows: <1%, almost certainly not; 1% to 5%, very 
unlikely; 5% to 25%, unlikely; 25% to 75%, possible; 75% to 95%, likely; 95% to 
99%, very likely; >99%, almost certainly. Changes were unclear for the match 
loads, sprint times, and perceptual markers between groups. Higher %ΔSJ at 24 h 
(very likely (ES = 0.75)) and in %ΔPPO_SJ at 48 h (likely (ES = 0.51)) were 
observed in CWI than in CON. Values in %ΔRDF_CMJ were higher immediately after 
(likely (ES = 0.83)), 30 min after (very likely (ES = 0.97)), and 24 h after the 
match (likely (ES = 0.93)) in CWI than in CON. Furthermore, %Δlog TNF-α were 
lower in the CWI group than in the CON group immediately after (almost certainly 
(ES = -0.76)), 24 h after (very likely (ES = -1.09)), and 72 h after the match 
(likely (ES = -0.51)), and in Δstiffness_SJ at 30 min after (likely (ES = 
-0.67)) and 48 h after the match (very likely (ES = -0.97)). Also, different 
within-groups effects throughout postmatch were reported. Implementing postmatch 
CWI-based strategies improved the recovery of markers of inflammation and 
fatigue in rugby players, despite no change in markers of speed or perceptual 
recovery.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of multiple cold-water 
immersions (CWIs) on muscle function, markers of muscle damage, systemic 
inflammation and ECM degradation following exercise-induced muscle damage 
(EIMD). Thirty physically active males were randomly assigned to either a 
control (n = 15) or cold-water immersion (CWI) group (n = 15). The CWI group 
performed one immersion (10 °C for 20 min) at post-exercise and every 24 h for 
the following 72 h, while the control group remained in a seated position during 
these corresponding periods. Muscle strength, vertical jump height, muscle 
thickness, delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS), systemic creatine kinase (CK), 
C-reactive protein (CRP), inflammatory cytokines and matrix 
metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activity were assessed at Pre, Post, 24, 48, 72, 96 
and 168 h following EIMD. No significant time × group interaction was obtained 
for muscle strength, vertical jump height recovery and MMP-2 
activity (p > 0.05). At 24 h, muscle thickness from the CWI group returned to 
baseline and was lower than the control (p = 0.04). DOMS returned to baseline at 
168 h for the CWI group (p = 0.109) but not for the control (p = 0.008). At 
168 h, CK showed a time-group difference with a greater peak for the control 
group (p = 0.016). In conclusion, multiple CWIs attenuated muscle damage, but 
not altered systemic inflammation and muscle function recovery.

Effects of Chronic Cold-Water Immersion in Elite Rugby Players.

Tavares F, Beaven M, Teles J, Baker D, Healey P, Smith TB, Driller M.

PURPOSE: Although the acute effects of cold-water immersion (CWI) have been 
widely investigated, research analyzing the effects of CWI over a chronic period 
in highly trained athletes is scarce. The aim of this study was to investigate 
the effects of CWI during an intense 3-wk preseason phase in elite rugby 
athletes.
METHODS: A total of 23 elite male rugby union athletes were randomized to either 
CWI (10 min at 10°C, n = 10) or a passive recovery control (CON, n = 13) during 
3 wk of high-volume training. Athletes were exposed to either CWI or CON after 
each training day (12 d in total). Running loads, conditioning, and gym sessions 
were kept the same between groups. Measures of countermovement jump, perceived 
muscle soreness, and wellness were obtained twice a week, and saliva samples for 
determining cortisol and interleukin-6 were collected once per week.
RESULTS: Although no significant differences were observed between CWI and CON 
for any measure, CWI resulted in lower fatigue markers throughout the study as 
demonstrated by the moderate effects on muscle soreness (d = 0.58-0.91) and 
interleukin-6 (d = -0.83) and the small effects (d = 0.23-0.38) on 
countermovement jump in comparison with CON.
CONCLUSIONS: CWI may provide some beneficial effect by reducing fatigue and 
soreness during an intense 3-wk training phase in elite rugby athletes.

OBJECTIVES: Cold water immersion (CWI) has been widely used for enhancing 
athlete recovery though its use following an Ironman triathlon has never been 
examined. The purpose of this paper is to determine the influence of CWI 
immediately following an Ironman triathlon on markers of muscle damage, 
inflammation and muscle soreness.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
METHODS: Thirty three (22 male, 11 female), triathletes participating in the 
Ironman World Championships volunteered to participate (mean±SD: age=40±11years; 
height=174.5±9.1cm; body mass=70±11.8kg; percent body fat=11.4±4.1%, finish 
time=11:03.00±01:25.08). Post race, participants were randomly assigned to a 
10-min bout of 10°C CWI or no-intervention control group. Data collection 
occurred pre-intervention (PRE), post-intervention (POST), 16h (16POST) and 40h 
(40POST) following the race. Linear mixed model ANOVA with Bonferroni 
corrections were performed to examine group by time differences for delayed 
onset muscle soreness (DOMS), hydration indices, myoglobin, creatine kinase 
(CK), cortisol, C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6 and percent body mass loss 
(%BML). Pearson's bivariate correlations were used for comparisons with 
finishing time. Alpha level was set a priori at 0.05.
RESULTS: No significant group by time interactions occurred. Significant 
differences occurred for POST BML (-1.7±0.9kg) vs. 16POST, and 40POST BML 
(0.9±1.4, -0.1±1.2kg, respectively; p<0.001). Compared to PRE, myoglobin, CRP 
and CK remained significantly elevated at 40POST. Cortisol returned to PRE 
values by 16POST and IL-6 returned to PRE values by 40POST.
CONCLUSION: A single bout of CWI did not provide any physiological benefit 
during recovery from a triathlon within 40h post race. Effect of CWI beyond this 
time is unknown.

Endurance exercise performance is impaired in a hot and humid environment. This 
study compared the effects of cold water immersion, with (CMWI) and without 
(CWI) menthol, on the recovery of cycling performance. Eight heat-acclimatized 
cyclists (age, 24.1 ± 4.4 years; mass, 65.3 ± 5.2 kg) performed 2 randomized 
sessions, each consisting of a 20-min cycling trial (T1) followed by 10 min of 
immersion during recovery and then a second 20-min cycling trial (T2). Mean 
power output and perceived exertion (RPE) were recorded for both trials. Rectal 
(Trec) and skin temperatures were measured before and immediately after T1, 
immersion, and T2. Perceived thermal sensation (TS) and comfort were measured 
immediately after T1 and T2. Power output was significantly improved in T2 
compared with T1 in the CMWI condition (+15.6%). Performance did not change in 
the CWI condition. After immersion, Trec was lower in CWI (-1.17 °C) than in 
CMWI (-0.6 °C). TS decreased significantly after immersion in both conditions. 
This decline was significantly more pronounced in CMWI (5.9 ± 1 to 3.6 ± 0.5) 
than in CWI (5.6 ± 0.9 to 4.4 ± 1.2). In CMWI, RPE was significantly higher in 
T1 (6.57 ± 0.9) than in T2 (5.14 ± 1.25). However, there was no difference in 
TC. This study suggests that menthol immersion probably (i) improves the 
performance of a repeated 20-min cycling bout, (ii) decreases TS, and (iii) 
impairs thermoregulation processes.

The aim of this study is to compare (a) the physiological responses following 
cold-water immersion (CWI) and partial-body cryotherapy (PBC) and (b) the 
effects on recovery following a muscle-damaging protocol (5 × 20 drop jumps). 
Nineteen healthy males were randomly allocated into either a CWI (10°C for 
10 minutes; n = 9) or a PBC (-60°C for 30 seconds, -135°C for 2 minutes; n = 10) 
group. The physiological variables (thigh muscle oxygen saturation [SmO2 ], 
cutaneous vascular conductance [CVC], mean arterial pressure [MAP], and local 
skin temperature) were assessed immediately prior and up to 60 minutes 
post-treatment (10-minutes intervals). The recovery variables (thigh muscle 
swelling, maximum voluntary contraction [MVC] of the right knee extensors, 
vertical jump performance [VJP], and delayed onset of muscle soreness [DOMS]) 
were measured immediately prior and up to 72 hours post-treatment (24-hours 
intervals). Compared to PBC values, CVC (at 30 minutes), SmO2 (at 40 minutes), 
and lower extremity skin temperature (thigh/shin at 60 minutes) were 
significantly reduced in the CWI group after the treatment (all P < .05). Only 
lower extremity skin temperature was significantly reduced in the PBC group 
directly post-treatment (all P < .05). MAP significantly increased in both 
groups after the treatments (both P < .05). DOMS did not differ between groups. 
MVC and VJP returned to baseline in both groups after 24 hours (P > .05). CWI 
had a greater impact on the physiological response compared to PBC. However, 
both treatments resulted in similar recovery profiles during a 72-hours 
follow-up period.

PURPOSE: Cryotherapy is an increasingly popular recovery strategy used in an 
attempt to attenuate the negative impact of strenuous physical activity on 
subsequent exercise. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the effects of whole 
body cryotherapy (WBC) and cold water immersion (CWI) on markers of recovery 
following a marathon.
METHODS: Thirty-one endurance trained males completed a marathon. Participants 
were randomly assigned to a CWI, WBC or placebo group. Perceptions of muscle 
soreness, training stress and markers of muscle function were recorded before 
the marathon and at 24 and 48 h post exercise. Blood samples were taken at 
baseline, post intervention and 24 and 48 h post intervention to assess 
inflammation and muscle damage.
RESULTS: WBC had a harmful effect on muscle function compared to CWI post 
marathon. WBC positively influenced perceptions of training stress compared to 
CWI. With the exception of C-reactive protein (CRP) at 24 and 48 h, neither 
cryotherapy intervention positively influenced blood borne markers of 
inflammation or structural damage compared to placebo.
CONCLUSION: The findings show WBC has a negative impact on muscle function, 
perceptions of soreness and a number of blood parameters compared to CWI, 
contradicting the suggestion that WBC may be a superior recovery strategy. 
Further, cryotherapy is no more effective than a placebo intervention at 
improving functional recovery or perceptions of training stress following a 
marathon. These findings lend further evidence to suggest that treatment belief 
and the placebo effect may be largely responsible for the beneficial effects of 
cryotherapy on recovery following a marathon.

thickness after resistance training. J Strength Cond Res 32(3): 756-763, 
2018-Cold-water immersion (CWI) is commonly applied to speed up the recovery 
process after exercise. Muscle damage may induce a performance reduction and 
consequence of the intramuscular pressure induced by the muscular swelling. The 
aim of the study was to verify the CWI effects on muscle thickness (MT) behavior 
of the elbow flexors after a strength training (ST) protocol. Eleven men were 
submitted to an ST, performed in 2 different weeks. In one of the weeks, 
subjects experienced a passive recovery. In the other, subjects were submitted 
to a CWI (20 minutes at 5-10° C). Ultrasound (US) images were taken before, 
after, as well as 24, 48, and 72 hours after exercise, to evaluate the MT. 
Muscle thickness in both exercise arm (EA) and control arm (CA) was 
significantly higher 48 and 72 hours after exercise when subjects were submitted 
to a passive recovery compared with the CWI (p = 0.029, p = 0.028, p = 0.009, 
and p = 0.001, 48 hours, 72 hours, EA, and CA, respectively). When each arm was 
analyzed with or without using CWI individually, significantly higher MT was 
observed in the EA with CWI: before exercise in relation to 72 hours after 
exercise (p = 0.042) and after exercise in relation to the other measurements (p 
= 0.003, p = 0.003, p = 0.038, and p < 0.0001, before exercise and 24, 48, 72 
hours after exercise, respectively). The evaluation of MT by US provides 
evidence that CWI after ST (and 24 hours after exercise) may reduce muscle 
swelling in the postexercise days when compared with a passive recovery. Seems 
to be a paradox between the uses of CWI for an acute reduction of muscle 
swelling.

BACKGROUND: Conditioned pain modulation (CPM) evaluates the pain modulating 
effect of a noxious conditioning stimulus (CS) on another noxious test stimulus 
(TS), mostly based solely on subjective pain ratings. We used painful cutaneous 
electrical stimulation (PCES) to induce TS in a novel CPM-model. Additionally, 
to evaluate a more objective parameter, we recorded the corresponding changes of 
cortical evoked potentials (PCES-EP).
METHODS: We examined the CPM-effect in 17 healthy subjects in a randomized 
controlled cross-over design during immersion of the non-dominant hand into 
10 °C or 24 °C cold water (CS). Using three custom-built concentric surface 
electrodes, electrical stimuli were applied on the dominant hand, inducing pain 
of 40-60 on NRS 0-100 (TS). At baseline, during and after CS we assessed the 
electrically induced pain intensity and electrically evoked potentials recorded 
over the central electrode (Cz).
RESULTS: Only in the 10 °C-condition, both pain (52.6 ± 4.4 (baseline) vs. 
30.3 ± 12.5 (during CS)) and amplitudes of PCES-EP (42.1 ± 13.4 μV (baseline) 
vs. 28.7 ± 10.5 μV (during CS)) attenuated during CS and recovered there after 
(all p < 0.001). In the 10 °C-condition changes of subjective pain ratings 
during electrical stimulation and amplitudes of PCES-EP correlated significantly 
with each other (r = 0.5) and with CS pain intensity (r = 0.5).
CONCLUSIONS: PCES-EPs are a quantitative measure of pain relief, as changes in 
the electrophysiological response are paralleled by a consistent decrease in 
subjective pain ratings. This novel CPM paradigm is a feasible method, which 
could help to evaluate the function of the endogenous pain modulation processes.

We investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms by which postexercise 
cold-water immersion (CWI) may alter key markers of mitochondrial biogenesis 
following both a single session and 6 wk of sprint interval training (SIT). 
Nineteen men performed a single SIT session, followed by one of two 15-min 
recovery conditions: cold-water immersion (10°C) or a passive room temperature 
control (23°C). Sixteen of these participants also completed 6 wk of SIT, each 
session followed immediately by their designated recovery condition. Four muscle 
biopsies were obtained in total, three during the single SIT session 
(preexercise, postrecovery, and 3 h postrecovery) and one 48 h after the last 
SIT session. After a single SIT session, phosphorylated (p-)AMPK, p-p38 MAPK, 
p-p53, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) 
mRNA were all increased (P < 0.05). Postexercise CWI had no effect on these 
responses. Consistent with the lack of a response after a single session, 
regular postexercise CWI had no effect on PGC-1α or p53 protein content. Six 
weeks of SIT increased peak aerobic power, maximal oxygen consumption, maximal 
uncoupled respiration (complexes I and II), and 2-km time trial performance (P < 
0.05). However, regular CWI had no effect on changes in these markers, 
consistent with the lack of response in the markers of mitochondrial biogenesis. 
Although these observations suggest that CWI is not detrimental to endurance 
adaptations following 6 wk of SIT, they question whether postexercise CWI is an 
effective strategy to promote mitochondrial biogenesis and improvements in 
endurance performance.

precooling strategy and supplementation coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) on superoxide 
dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and serum glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in 
elite, adolescent swimmers during heavy and regular trainings and recording of 
freestyle swimming. Thirty-six healthy males (mean ± SD; age: 17.5 ± 1.1 years, 
body fat content: 14.55 ± 1.75%) were randomly selected and divided into 4 
groups of CoQ10 (300 mg·d), precooling (immersion in the water at 18 ± 0.5° C), 
supplementation with precooling, and control, each with 9 participants. During 
an 18-session protocol in the morning and evening, participants attended speed 
and endurance trainings for 5 km every session. A 3-stage blood sampling was 
conducted before the first recording and before and after the second recording 
in 800, 200, and 50 m. Repeated measurement and the Bonferroni correction were 
used for the statistical analyses of the data (α = 0.05). According to the 
results, there was no significant difference between the mean serum level of 
SOD, CAT, and GPx in the groups at the first stage of blood sampling (p > 0.05). 
At the third stage, a significant difference was observed among all groups (p < 
0.05). At the second stage, precooling and control groups show a significant 
increase compared with the supplementation and supplementation with precooling 
groups (p < 0.05). As an antioxidant essential for adenosine triphosphate 
synthesis, CoQ10 supplementation prevented adverse changes of antioxidant 
enzymes during heavy trainings and swimming recording and decreased the serum 
level, while precooling individually increased serum level of antioxidant 
enzymes by itself.

daily cold water immersion (CWI) on physical performance, muscle damage, and 
inflammatory, hormonal, and oxidative stress markers in volleyball. Six players 
were submitted to CWI and six players to a placebo, during 5 training days. 
Thigh circumference, squat jump, and agility were measured on the first, third, 
and sixth days. On the first and sixth days, blood and saliva were collected for 
analysis of oxidative stress, muscle damage, and inflammatory and hormonal 
levels. Muscle soreness and countermovement jump were quantified daily. The 
physical performance comparisons did not present differences and the only 
between group comparison with a large effect size (ES = -1.39) was in Δ% between 
day 1 and day 2 for countermovement jump. Delayed onset muscle soreness and 
creatine kinase increased in both groups and the ESs of between group 
comparisons of Δ% between moments were not more than moderate. Thigh 
circumference increased only in the placebo group (p = 0.04) and the ES of the 
between group comparisons of Δ% between moments was large (1.53). No differences 
were found in oxidative stress, or inflammatory markers. Cortisol decreased only 
in the CWI-group (p ≤ 0.05) and the ESs of the between group comparisons of Δ% 
between moments of the testosterone to cortisol ratio (-1.94) and insulin-like 
growth-1 (-1.34) were large. Despite the positive effects of daily CWI on muscle 
edema and hormonal status, the limited effects of CWI on performance, muscle 
damage, inflammation markers, and reactive oxygen species mediators signal the 
unimportance of the daily practice of this recovery method in volleyball 
players.

OBJECTIVES: The main objective of this study was to compare two cold water 
immersion protocols, continuous or intermittent, on recovery in basketball 
players.
METHODS: Ten male basketball players (age: 14 ± 0.4 years, body mass: 
65.4 ± 9.1 kg, height: 175 ± 7.3 cm, body fat %: 10.3 ± 4) were included in the 
study. After three 90-minute training sessions (avg. heart rate 158 ± 11.92, 
156 ± 7.06 and 151 ± 10.44 bpm), participants were grouped into a continuous 
immersion (12 min at 12 ± 0.4°C) group, intermittent immersion (4 x 2 min 
immersion at 12 ± 0.4 °C + 1 min out of water) group and a control group (CG). 
Countermovement jump (CMJ), muscle pain and thigh volume were measured.
RESULTS: Both cold water immersion protocols were effective in reducing the pain 
24 and 48 hours after training compared with the CG (F (3.54) = 2.91, p = 0.016, 
ηp2 = .24). Concerning CMJ change, % differences occurred at 24 (Z = 11.04, 
p = 0.004) and 48 hours (Z = 14.01, p < 0.001) in comparison with the CG. 
Regarding the muscle volume, the statistical analysis did not report a 
significant interaction (F (3.54) = 2.42, p = 0.058).
CONCLUSION: Both cold water immersion CWI protocols are effective in improving 
recovery in basketball players.

BACKGROUND: This single-blinded, three-armed randomized controlled trial aimed 
to compare the effects of postexercise ice-water immersion (IWI), 
room-temperature water immersion (RWI), and no water immersion on the balance 
performance and knee joint proprioception of amateur rugby players.
METHODS: Fifty-three eligible amateur rugby players (mean age ± standard 
deviation: 21.6 ± 2.9 years) were randomly assigned to the IWI group (5.3 °C), 
RWI group (25.0 °C), or the no immersion control group. The participants in each 
group underwent the same fatigue protocol followed by their allocated recovery 
intervention, which lasted for 1 minute. Measurements were taken before and 
after the fatigue-recovery intervention. The primary outcomes were the sensory 
organization test (SOT) composite equilibrium score (ES) and the 
condition-specific ES, which were measured using a computerized dynamic 
posturography machine. The secondary outcome was the knee joint repositioning 
error. Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance was used to test the 
effect of water immersion on each outcome variable.
RESULTS: There were no significant within- and between-group differences in the 
SOT composite ESs or the condition-specific ESs. However, there was a 
group-by-time interaction effect on the knee joint repositioning error. It seems 
that participants in the RWI group had lower errors over time, but those in the 
IWI and control groups had increased errors over time. The RWI group had 
significantly lower error score than the IWI group at postintervention.
CONCLUSION: One minute of postexercise IWI or RWI did not impair rugby players' 
sensory organization of balance control. RWI had a less detrimental effect on 
knee joint proprioception to IWI at postintervention.

Environments Laboratory, Department of Sport and Exercise Science, University of 
Portsmouth, Portsmouth, UNITED KINGDOM.

PURPOSE: Cold-water immersion (CWI) and whole body cryotherapy (WBC) are widely 
used recovery methods in an attempt to limit exercise-induced muscle damage, 
soreness, and functional deficits after strenuous exercise. The aim of this 
study was to compare the effects of ecologically valid CWI and WBC protocols on 
postexercise lower limb thermoregulatory, femoral artery, and cutaneous blood 
flow responses.
METHODS: Ten males completed a continuous cycle exercise protocol at 70% maximal 
oxygen uptake until a rectal temperature of 38°C was attained. Participants were 
then exposed to lower-body CWI (8°C) for 10 min, or WBC (-110°C) for 2 min, in a 
randomized crossover design. Rectal and thigh skin, deep, and superficial muscle 
temperatures, thigh, and calf skin blood flow (laser Doppler flowmetry), 
superficial femoral artery blood flow (duplex ultrasound), and arterial blood 
pressure were measured before, and for 40 min post, cooling interventions.
RESULTS: Greater reductions in thigh skin (CWI, -5.9°C ± 1.8°C; WBC, 0.2°C ± 
0.5°C; P < 0.001) and superficial (CWI, -4.4°C ± 1.3°C; WBC, -1.8°C ± 1.1°C; P < 
0.001) and deep (CWI, -2.9°C ± 0.8°C; WBC, -1.3°C ± 0.6°C; P < 0.001) muscle 
temperatures occurred immediately after CWI. Decreases in femoral artery 
conductance were greater after CWI (CWI, -84% ± 11%; WBC, -59% ± 21%, P < 0.02) 
and thigh (CWI, -80% ± 5%; WBC, -59% ± 14%, P < 0.001), and calf (CWI, -73% ± 
13%; WBC, -45% ± 17%, P < 0.001) cutaneous vasoconstriction was greater after 
CWI. Reductions in rectal temperature were similar between conditions after 
cooling (CWI, -0.6°C ± 0.4°C; WBC, -0.6°C ± 0.3°C; P = 0.98).
CONCLUSION: Greater reductions in blood flow and tissue temperature were 
observed after CWI in comparison with WBC. These novel findings have practical 
and clinical implications for the use of cooling in the recovery from exercise 
and injury.

BACKGROUND: Cold water immersion (CWI) is a commonly used recuperative strategy. 
However there is a lack of standardization of protocols considering the duration 
and temperature of application of the technique and the stress model. Therefore 
it is important to study the issue of dose response in a specific stress model. 
Thus the objective was to analyze and compare the effects of CWI during intense 
post-exercise recovery using different durations and temperatures of immersion.
METHODS: One hundred and five male individuals were divided into five groups: 
one control group (CG) and four recovery groups (G1: 5' at 9±1 °C; G2: 5' at 
14±1 °C; G3: 15' at 9±1 °C; G4: 15' at 14±1 °C). The volunteers were submitted 
to an exhaustion protocol that consisted of a jump program and the Wingate Test. 
Immediately after the exhaustion protocol, the volunteers were directed to a 
tank with water and ice, where they were immersed for the recovery procedure, 
during which blood samples were collected for later lactate and creatine kinase 
(CK) analysis. Variables were collected prior to the exercise and 24, 48, 72, 
and 96 hours after its completion.
RESULTS: For the CK concentration, 15 minutes at 14 °C was the best intervention 
option, considering the values at 72 hours after exercise, while for the moment 
of peak lactate an advantage was observed for immersion for 5 minutes at 14 °C. 
Regarding the perception of recovery, CWI for 5 minutes at 14 °C performed 
better long-term, from the time of the intervention to 96 hours post-exercise. 
For pain, no form of immersion responded better than the CG at the immediately 
post-intervention moment.
CONCLUSIONS: There were no differences in behavior between the CWI intervention 
groups for the outcomes studied.

This study determined the influence of cold (8°C) and cool (22°C) water 
immersion on lower limb and cutaneous blood flow following resistance exercise. 
Twelve males completed 4 sets of 10-repetition maximum squat exercise and were 
then immersed, semi-reclined, into 8°C or 22°C water for 10-min, or rested in a 
seated position (control) in a randomized order on different days. Rectal and 
thigh skin temperature, muscle temperature, thigh and calf skin blood flow and 
superficial femoral artery blood flow were measured before and after immersion. 
Indices of vascular conductance were calculated (flux and blood flow/mean 
arterial pressure). The colder water reduced thigh skin temperature and deep 
muscle temperature to the greatest extent (P < .001). Reductions in rectal 
temperature were similar (0.2-0.4°C) in all three trials (P = .69). Femoral 
artery conductance was similar after immersion in both cooling conditions, with 
both conditions significantly lower (55%) than the control post-immersion 
(P < .01). Similarly, there was greater thigh and calf cutaneous 
vasoconstriction (40-50%) after immersion in both cooling conditions, relative 
to the control (P < .01), with no difference between cooling conditions. These 
findings suggest that cold and cool water similarly reduce femoral artery and 
cutaneous blood flow responses but not muscle temperature following resistance 
exercise.

CONTEXT:  Cooling devices aim to protect firefighters by attenuating a rise in 
body temperature. Devices for head cooling (HC) while firefighting and forearm 
cooling (FC) during rehabilitation (RHB) intervals are commonly marketed, but 
research regarding their efficacy is limited.
OBJECTIVE:  To investigate the physiological and perceived effects of HC and FC 
during firefighting drills and RHB.
DESIGN:  Randomized controlled clinical trial.
SETTING:  Firefighter training center.
PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS:  Twenty-seven male career firefighters (age = 39 
± 7 years; height = 169 ± 7 cm; weight = 95.4 ± 16.8 kg).
INTERVENTION(S):  Firefighters were randomly assigned to 1 condition: HC (n = 
9), in which participants completed drills wearing a cold gel pack inside their 
helmet; FC (n = 8), in which participants sat on a collapsible chair with 
water-immersion arm troughs during RHB; or control (n = 10), in which 
participants used no cooling devices. Firefighters completed four 15-minute 
drills (D1-D4) wearing full bunker gear and breathing apparatus. Participants 
had a 15-min RHB after D2 (RHB1) and D4 (RHB2).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S):  Change (Δ) in gastrointestinal temperature (TGI), 
heart rate (HR), physiological strain index, and perceived thermal sensation.
RESULTS:  The TGI increased similarly in the HC and control groups, respectively 
(D1: 0.57°C ± 0.41°C, 0.73°C ± 0.30°C; D2: 0.92°C ± 0.28°C, 0.85°C ± 0.27°C; D3: 
-0.37°C ± 0.34°C, -0.01°C ± 0.72°C; D4: 0.25°C ± 0.42°C, 0.57°C ± 0.26°C; P > 
.05). The ΔHR, Δ physiological strain index, and Δ thermal sensation were 
similar between the HC and control groups during drills (P > .05). The FC group 
demonstrated a decreased TGI compared with the control group after RHB1 (-1.61°C 
± 0.35°C versus -0.23°C ± 0.34°C; P < .001) and RHB2 (-1.40°C ± 0.38°C versus 
-0.38°C ± 0.24°C; P < .001). The physiological strain index score decreased in 
the FC group compared with the control group after RHB1 (-7.9 ± 1.3 versus -2.6 
± 1.7; P < .001) and RHB2 (-7.9 ± 1.6 versus -3.6 ± 1.1; P < .001), but no 
differences between groups were demonstrated for ΔHR or Δ thermal sensation (P > 
.05).
CONCLUSIONS:  The HC did not attenuate rises in physiological or perceptual 
variables during firefighting drills. The FC effectively reduced TGI and the 
physiological strain index score but not HR or thermal sensation during RHB. 
Clinicians and firefighters should not recommend the use of HC during 
firefighting but can consider using FC during RHB intervals in the field.

CONTEXT:  Recommended treatment for exertional heat stroke includes whole-body 
cold-water immersion (CWI). However, remote locations or monetary or spatial 
restrictions can challenge the feasibility of CWI. Thus, the development of a 
modified, portable CWI method would allow for optimal treatment of exertional 
heat stroke in the presence of these challenges.
OBJECTIVE:  To determine the cooling rate of modified CWI (tarp-assisted cooling 
with oscillation [TACO]) after exertional hyperthermia.
DESIGN:  Randomized, crossover controlled trial.
SETTING:  Environmental chamber (temperature = 33.4°C ± 0.8°C, relative humidity 
= 55.7% ± 1.9%).
PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS:  Sixteen volunteers (9 men, 7 women; age = 26 ± 
4.7 years, height = 1.76 ± 0.09 m, mass = 72.5 ± 9.0 kg, body fat = 20.7% ± 
7.1%) with no history of compromised thermoregulation.
INTERVENTION(S):  Participants completed volitional exercise (cycling or 
treadmill) until they demonstrated a rectal temperature (Tre) ≥39.0°C. After 
exercise, participants transitioned to a semirecumbent position on a tarp until 
either Tre reached 38.1°C or 15 minutes had elapsed during the control (no 
immersion [CON]) or TACO (immersion in 151 L of 2.1°C ± 0.8°C water) treatment.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S):  The Tre, heart rate, and blood pressure (reported as 
mean arterial pressure) were assessed precooling and postcooling. Statistical 
analyses included repeated-measures analysis of variance with appropriate post 
hoc t tests and Bonferroni correction.
RESULTS:  Before cooling, the Tre was not different between conditions (CON: 
39.27°C ± 0.26°C, TACO: 39.30°C ± 0.39°C; P = .62; effect size = -0.09; 95% 
confidence interval [CI] = -0.2, 0.1). At postcooling, the Tre was decreased in 
the TACO (38.10°C ± 0.16°C) compared with the CON condition (38.74°C ± 0.38°C; P 
< .001; effect size = 2.27; 95% CI = 0.4, 0.9). The rate of cooling was greater 
during the TACO (0.14 ± 0.06°C/min) than the CON treatment (0.04°C/min ± 
0.02°C/min; t15 = -8.84; P < .001; effect size = 2.21; 95% CI = -0.13, -0.08). 
These differences occurred despite an insignificant increase in fluid 
consumption during exercise preceding CON (0.26 ± 0.29 L) versus TACO (0.19 ± 
0.26 L; t12 = 1.73; P = .11; effect size = 0.48; 95% CI = -0.02, 0.14) 
treatment. Decreases in heart rate did not differ between the TACO and CON 
conditions (t15 = -1.81; P = .09; effect size = 0.45; 95% CI = -22, 2). Mean 
arterial pressure was greater at postcooling with TACO (84.2 ± 6.6 mm Hg) than 
with CON (67.0 ± 9.0 mm Hg; P < .001; effect size = 2.25; 95% CI = 13, 21).
CONCLUSIONS:  The TACO treatment provided faster cooling than did the CON 
treatment. When location, monetary, or spatial restrictions are present, TACO 
represents an effective alternative to traditional CWI in the emergency 
treatment of patients with exertional hyperthermia.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: We investigated the efficacy of tarp-assisted cooling as a body 
cooling modality.
METHODS: Participants exercised on a motorized treadmill in hot conditions 
(ambient temperature 39.5°C [103.1°F], SD 3.1°C [5.58°F]; relative humidity 
38.1% [SD 6.7%]) until they reached exercise-induced hyperthermia. After 
exercise, participants were cooled with either partial immersion using a 
tarp-assisted cooling method (water temperature 9.20°C [48.56°F], SD 2.81°C 
[5.06°F]) or passive cooling in a climatic chamber.
RESULTS: There were no differences in exercise duration (mean difference=0.10 
minutes; 95% CI -5.98 to 6.17 minutes or end exercise rectal temperature (mean 
difference=0.10°C [0.18°F]; 95% CI -0.05°C to 0.25°C [-0.09°F to 0.45°F] between 
tarp-assisted cooling (48.47 minutes [SD 8.27 minutes]; rectal temperature 
39.73°C [103.51°F], SD 0.27°C [0.49°F]) and passive cooling (48.37 minutes [SD 
7.10 minutes]; 39.63°C [103.33°F], SD 0.40°C [0.72°F]). Cooling time to rectal 
temperature 38.25°C (100.85°F) was significantly faster in tarp-assisted cooling 
(10.30 minutes [SD 1.33 minutes]) than passive cooling (42.78 [SD 5.87 
minutes]). Cooling rates for tarp-assisted cooling and passive cooling were 
0.17°C/min (0.31°F/min), SD 0.07°C/min (0.13°F/min) and 0.04°C/min (0.07°F/min), 
SD 0.01°C/min (0.02°F/min), respectively (mean difference=0.13°C [0.23°F]; 95% 
CI 0.09°C to 0.17°C [0.16°F to 0.31°F]. No sex differences were observed in 
tarp-assisted cooling rates (men 0.17°C/min [0.31°F/min], SD 0.07°C/min 
[0.13°F/min]; women 0.16°C/min [0.29°F/min], SD 0.07°C/min [0.13°F/min]; mean 
difference=0.02°C/min [0.04°F/min]; 95% CI -0.06°C/min to 0.10°C/min 
[-0.11°F/min to 0.18°F/min]). Women (0.04°C/min [0.07°F/min], SD 0.01°C/min 
[0.02°F/min]) had greater cooling rates than men (0.03°C/min [0.05°F/min], SD 
0.01°C/min [0.02°F/min]) in passive cooling, with negligible clinical effect 
(mean difference=0.01°C/min [0.02°F/min]; 95% CI 0.001°C/min to 0.024°C/min 
[0.002°F/min to 0.04°F/min]). Body mass was moderately negatively correlated 
with the cooling rate in passive cooling (r=-0.580) but not in tarp-assisted 
cooling (r=-0.206).
CONCLUSION: In the absence of a stationary cooling method such as cold-water 
immersion, tarp-assisted cooling can serve as an alternative, field-expedient 
method to provide on-site cooling with a satisfactory cooling rate.

This study investigated the effects of 5 and 15°C cold-water immersion on 
recovery from exercise resulting in exercise-induced muscle damage. 42 
college-aged men performed 5×20 drop-jumps and were randomly allocated into one 
of 3 groups: (1) 5°C; (2) 15°C; or (3) control. After exercise, individuals from 
the cold-water immersion groups had their lower limbs immerged in iced water for 
20 min. Isometric knee extensor torque, countermovement jump, muscle soreness, 
and creatine kinase were measured before, immediately after, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 
168 h post-exercise. There was no between-group difference in isometric strength 
recovery (p=0.73). However, countermovement jump recovered quicker in cold-water 
immersion groups compared to control group (p<0.05). Countermovement jump 
returned to baseline after 72 h in 15°C, 5°C group recovered after 96 h and 
control did not recovered at any time point measured. Also, creatine kinase 
returned to baseline at 72 h and remained stable for all remaining measurements 
for 15°C group, whereas remained elevated past 168 h in both 5°C and control 
groups. There was a trend toward lower muscle soreness (p=0.06) in 15°C group 
compared to control at 24 h post-exercise. The result suggests that cold-water 
immersion promote recovery of stretch-shortening cycle performance, but not 
influence the recovery of maximal contractile force. Immersion at warmer 
temperature may be more effective than colder temperatures promoting recovery 
from strenuous exercise.

A brief cold water immersion between 2 continuous high-intensity exercise bouts 
improves the performance of the latter compared with passive recovery in the 
heat. We investigated if this effect is apparent in normothermic conditions (∼19 
°C), employing an intermittent high-intensity exercise designed to reflect the 
work performed at the high-intensity domain in team sports. Fifteen young active 
men completed 2 exhaustive cycling protocols (Ex1 and Ex2: 12 min at 85% 
ventilatory threshold (VT) and then an intermittent exercise alternating 30-s at 
40% peak power (Ppeak) and 30 s at 90% Ppeak to exhaustion) separated by 15 min 
of (i) passive rest, (ii) 5-min cold-water immersion at 8 °C, and (iii) 10-min 
cold-water immersion at 8 °C. Core temperature, heart rate, rates of perceived 
exertion, and oxygen uptake kinetics were not different during Ex1 among 
conditions. Time to failure during the intermittent exercise was significantly 
(P < 0.05) longer during Ex2 following the 5- and 10-min cold-water immersions 
(7.2 ± 3.5 min and 7.3 ± 3.3 min, respectively) compared with passive rest (5.8 
± 3.1 min). Core temperature, heart rate, and rates of perceived exertion were 
significantly (P < 0.05) lower during most periods of Ex2 after both cold-water 
immersions compared with passive rest. The time constant of phase II oxygen 
uptake response during the 85% VT bout of Ex2 was not different among the 3 
conditions. A postexercise, 5- to 10-min cold-water immersion increases 
subsequent intermittent high-intensity exercise compared with passive rest in 
normothermia due, at least in part, to reductions in core temperature, 
circulatory strain, and effort perception.

KEY POINTS: Cold water immersion and active recovery are common post-exercise 
recovery treatments. A key assumption about the benefits of cold water immersion 
is that it reduces inflammation in skeletal muscle. However, no data are 
available from humans to support this notion. We compared the effects of cold 
water immersion and active recovery on inflammatory and cellular stress 
responses in skeletal muscle from exercise-trained men 2, 24 and 48 h during 
recovery after acute resistance exercise. Exercise led to the infiltration of 
inflammatory cells, with increased mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines 
and neurotrophins, and the subcellular translocation of heat shock proteins in 
muscle. These responses did not differ significantly between cold water 
immersion and active recovery. Our results suggest that cold water immersion is 
no more effective than active recovery for minimizing the inflammatory and 
stress responses in muscle after resistance exercise.
ABSTRACT: Cold water immersion and active recovery are common post-exercise 
recovery treatments. However, little is known about whether these treatments 
influence inflammation and cellular stress in human skeletal muscle after 
exercise. We compared the effects of cold water immersion versus active recovery 
on inflammatory cells, pro-inflammatory cytokines, neurotrophins and heat shock 
proteins (HSPs) in skeletal muscle after intense resistance exercise. Nine 
active men performed unilateral lower-body resistance exercise on separate days, 
at least 1 week apart. On one day, they immersed their lower body in cold water 
(10°C) for 10 min after exercise. On the other day, they cycled at a low 
intensity for 10 min after exercise. Muscle biopsies were collected from the 
exercised leg before, 2, 24 and 48 h after exercise in both trials. Exercise 
increased intramuscular neutrophil and macrophage counts, MAC1 and CD163 mRNA 
expression (P < 0.05). Exercise also increased IL1β, TNF, IL6, CCL2, CCL4, 
CXCL2, IL8 and LIF mRNA expression (P < 0.05). As evidence of hyperalgesia, the 
expression of NGF and GDNF mRNA increased after exercise (P < 0.05). The 
cytosolic protein content of αB-crystallin and HSP70 decreased after exercise 
(P < 0.05). This response was accompanied by increases in the cytoskeletal 
protein content of αB-crystallin and the percentage of type II fibres stained 
for αB-crystallin. Changes in inflammatory cells, cytokines, neurotrophins and 
HSPs did not differ significantly between the recovery treatments. These 
findings indicate that cold water immersion is no more effective than active 
recovery for reducing inflammation or cellular stress in muscle after a bout of 
resistance exercise.

PURPOSE: We tested the hypothesis that both post-exercise and passive cold water 
immersion (CWI) increases PGC-1α and VEGF mRNA expression in human skeletal 
muscle.
METHOD: Study 1 Nine males completed an intermittent running protocol (8 × 3-min 
bouts at 90 % [Formula: see text], interspersed with 3-min active recovery 
(1.5-min at 25 % and 1.5-min at 50 % [Formula: see text]) before undergoing CWI 
(10 min at 8 °C) or seated rest (CONT) in a counterbalanced, randomised manner. 
Study 2 Ten males underwent an identical CWI protocol under passive conditions.
RESULTS: Study 1 PGC-1α mRNA increased in CONT (~3.4-fold; P < 0.001) and CWI 
(~5.9-fold; P < 0.001) at 3 h post-exercise with a greater increase observed in 
CWI (P < 0.001). VEGFtotal mRNA increased after CWI only (~2.4-fold) compared 
with CONT (~1.1-fold) at 3 h post-exercise (P < 0.01). Study 2 Following CWI, 
PGC-1α mRNA expression was significantly increased ~1.3-fold (P = 0.001) and 
1.4-fold (P = 0.0004) at 3 and 6 h, respectively. Similarly, VEGF165 mRNA was 
significantly increased in CWI ~1.9-fold (P = 0.03) and 2.2-fold (P = 0.009) at 
3 and 6 h post-immersion.
CONCLUSIONS: Data confirm post-exercise CWI augments the acute exercise-induced 
expression of PGC-1α mRNA in human skeletal muscle compared to exercise per se. 
Additionally CWI per se mediates the activation of PGC-1α and VEGF mRNA 
expression in human skeletal muscle. Cold water may therefore enhance the 
adaptive response to acute exercise.

CONTEXT: Cold-water immersion (CWI) has been applied widely as a recovery 
method, but little evidence is available to support its effectiveness.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of CWI on muscle damage, perceived muscle 
soreness, and muscle power recovery of the upper and lower limbs after jiu-jitsu 
training.
DESIGN: Crossover study.
SETTING: Laboratory and field.
PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: A total of 8 highly trained male athletes (age = 
24.0 ± 3.6 years, mass = 78.4 ± 2.4 kg, percentage of body fat = 13.1% ± 3.6%) 
completed all study phases.
INTERVENTION(S): We randomly selected half of the sample for recovery using CWI 
(6.0°C ± 0.5°C) for 19 minutes; the other participants were allocated to the 
control condition (passive recovery). Treatments were reversed in the second 
session (after 1 week).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): We measured serum levels of creatine phosphokinase, 
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine 
aminotransferase enzymes; perceived muscle soreness; and recovery through visual 
analogue scales and muscle power of the upper and lower limbs at pretraining, 
postrecovery, 24 hours, and 48 hours.
RESULTS: Athletes who underwent CWI showed better posttraining recovery measures 
because circulating LDH levels were lower at 24 hours postrecovery in the CWI 
condition (441.9 ± 81.4 IU/L) than in the control condition (493.6 ± 97.4 IU/L; 
P = .03). Estimated muscle power was higher in the CWI than in the control 
condition for both upper limbs (757.9 ± 125.1 W versus 695.9 ± 56.1 W) and lower 
limbs (53.7 ± 3.7 cm versus 35.5 ± 8.2 cm; both P values = .001). In addition, 
we observed less perceived muscle soreness (1.5 ± 1.1 arbitrary units [au] 
versus 3.1 ± 1.0 au; P = .004) and higher perceived recovery (8.8 ± 1.9 au 
versus 6.9 ± 1.7 au; P = .005) in the CWI than in the control condition at 24 
hours postrecovery.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of CWI can be beneficial to jiu-jitsu athletes because it 
reduces circulating LDH levels, results in less perceived muscle soreness, and 
helps muscle power recovery at 24 hours postrecovery.

Cold water immersion (CWI) and ice massage (IM) are commonly used treatments to 
prevent the delay onset of muscle soreness (DOMS); however, little is known on 
their relative benefits and effectiveness to lower tissue temperature. This 
study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of IM and CMI on tissue 
temperature and potential benefit to preventing DOMS. The research encompassed 
36 subjects divided into three groups of twelve depending on the form of 
recovery: ice massage (IM), cold-water immersion (CWI), or passive recovery 
(PAS). All the participants were asked to jump as high as possible from a full 
squat for one minute. Thermal imaging was conducted at rest, immediately 
following the exercise, immediately after the trial, following the recovery 
treatment, and after 30min of rest. Their pain levels were assessed using the 
Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). After applying the selected method for supporting 
recovery, the LA level decreased by 4.25mmol/L in the IM group, and by 
4.96mmol/L in the CWI group (IM vs. CWI p>0.05). The 2.75mmol/L decrease in 
lactate concentration in the PAS group was significantly lower than in the other 
groups (IM vs. PAS p<0.05/ CWI vs. PAS p<0.01). In both groups, Tsk after 30min 
was significantly lower (ΔTsk~0.5°C) than at rest (p<0.05). In turn, Tsk in the 
PAS group returned to the resting values (p>0.05). Seventy-two hours after the 
exercise, a clear decrease in discomfort was observed in the IM and CWI groups 
compared to the PAS group. The two applied treatments have proven to be 
effective both in utilizing lactate and preventing DOMS. Depending on training 
requirements, we recommend the use of IM when athletes experience localized 
muscle fatigue. One the other hand, CWI is recommended in situations of global 
or generalized muscle injury or fatigue.

This study compared the effect of postexercise water immersion (WI) at different 
temperatures on common femoral artery blood flow (CFA), muscle (total 
haemoglobin; tHb) and skin perfusion (cutaneous vascular conductance; CVC), 
assessed by Doppler ultrasound, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and laser 
Doppler flowmetry, respectively. Given that heat stress may influence the 
vascular response during cooling, nine men cycled for 25 min at the first 
ventilatory threshold followed by intermittent 30-s cycling at 90% peak power 
until exhaustion at 32·8 ± 0·4°C and 32 ± 5% RH. They then received 5-min WI at 
8·6 ± 0·2°C (WI9 ), 14·6 ± 0·3°C (WI15 ), 35·0 ± 0·4°C (WI35 ) or passive rest 
(CON) in a randomized, crossover manner. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure 
(MAP), muscle (Tmu ), thigh skin (Tthigh ), rectal (Tre ) and mean body (Tbody ) 
temperatures were assessed. At 60 min postimmersion, decreases in Tre after WI35 
(-0·6 ± 0·3°C) and CON (-0·6 ± 0·3°C) were different from WI15 (-1·0 ± 0·3°C; 
P<0·05), but not from WI9 (-1·0 ± 0·3°C; P = 0·074-0·092). WI9 and WI15 had 
reduced Tbody , Tthigh and Tmu compared with WI35 and CON (P <0·05). CFA, tHb 
and CVC were lower in WI9 and WI15 compared with CON (P<0·05). tHb following WI9 
remained lower than CON (P = 0·044) at 30 min postimmersion. CVC correlated with 
tHb during non-cooling (WI35 and CON) (r2  = 0·532; P<0·001) and cooling 
recovery (WI9 and WI15 ) (r2  = 0·19; P = 0·035). WI9 resulted in prolonged 
reduction in muscle perfusion. This suggests that CWI below 10°C should not be 
used for short-term (i.e. <60 min) recovery after exercise.

Cold-water immersion (CWI) is one of the recovery techniques commonly used by 
athletes for post-exercise recovery. Nevertheless, the effects of CWI using 
different temperatures and the dose-response relationship of this technique have 
not yet been investigated. The aims of this study were to compare the effects of 
two strategies of CWI, using different water temperatures with passive recovery 
post exercise in the management of some markers of muscle damage, and to observe 
whether any of the techniques used caused deleterious effects on performance. 
Sixty healthy male participants performed an eccentric protocol to induce muscle 
damage and were then randomized to one of three groups (CWI1: 15 min at 9 °C; 
CWI2: 15 min at 14 °C; CG: control group). Levels of creatine kinase, muscle 
soreness, pain threshold, perception of recovery, and maximal voluntary 
isometric contraction were monitored up to 96 h post exercise. A large effect 
for time for all outcomes was observed [P < 0.001; CK (ES = 0.516), muscle 
soreness (ES = 0.368); pain threshold (ES = 0.184); perception of recovery 
(ES = 0.565); MVIC (ES = 0.273)]. CWI groups presented an earlier recovery for 
muscle soreness with lower ratings immediately post recovery. For delayed 
effects, the application of CWI2 (15 min at 14 °C) presented earlier recovery 
compared with CWI1 and control condition for maximal voluntary isometric 
contraction (P < 0.05). There were no significant group and interaction (Group × 
Time) effects. CWI groups acted more efficiently for muscle soreness and 
performance considering the time of recovery was observed. No evidence was found 
to suggest dose-response relationship and deleterious effects.

Recovery From Exercise-Induced Muscle Damage: Cold-Water Immersion Versus 
Whole-Body Cryotherapy.

Abaïdia AE, Lamblin J, Delecroix B, Leduc C, McCall A, Nédélec M, Dawson B, 
Baquet G, Dupont G.

PURPOSE: To compare the effects of cold-water immersion (CWI) and whole-body 
cryotherapy (WBC) on recovery kinetics after exercise-induced muscle damage.
METHODS: Ten physically active men performed single-leg hamstring eccentric 
exercise comprising 5 sets of 15 repetitions. Immediately postexercise, subjects 
were exposed in a randomized crossover design to CWI (10 min at 10°C) or WBC (3 
min at -110°C) recovery. Creatine kinase concentrations, knee-flexor eccentric 
(60°/s) and posterior lower-limb isometric (60°) strength, single-leg and 2-leg 
countermovement jumps, muscle soreness, and perception of recovery were 
measured. The tests were performed before and immediately, 24, 48, and 72 h 
after exercise.
RESULTS: Results showed a very likely moderate effect in favor of CWI for 
single-leg (effect size [ES] = 0.63; 90% confidence interval [CI] = -0.13 to 
1.38) and 2-leg countermovement jump (ES = 0.68; 90% CI = -0.08 to 1.43) 72 h 
after exercise. Soreness was moderately lower 48 h after exercise after CWI (ES 
= -0.68; 90% CI = -1.44 to 0.07). Perception of recovery was moderately enhanced 
24 h after exercise for CWI (ES = -0.62; 90% CI = -1.38 to 0.13). Trivial and 
small effects of condition were found for the other outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: CWI was more effective than WBC in accelerating recovery kinetics 
for countermovement-jump performance at 72 h postexercise. CWI also demonstrated 
lower soreness and higher perceived recovery levels across 24-48 h postexercise.

performance in the heat. J Strength Cond Res 31(3): 620-629, 2017-The purpose of 
this investigation was to assess the effect of combining practical methods to 
cool the body on endurance running performance and physiology in the heat. 
Eleven trained male runners completed 4 randomized, preloaded running time 
trials (20 minutes at 70% V[Combining Dot Above]O2max and a 3 km time trial) on 
a nonmotorized treadmill in the heat (33° C). Trials consisted of precooling by 
combined cold-water immersion and ice slurry ingestion (PRE), midcooling by 
combined facial water spray and menthol mouth rinse (MID), a combination of all 
methods (ALL), and control (CON). Performance time was significantly faster in 
MID (13.7 ± 1.2 minutes; p < 0.01) and ALL (13.7 ± 1.4 minutes; p = 0.04) but 
not PRE (13.9 ± 1.4 minutes; p = 0.24) when compared with CON (14.2 ± 1.2 
minutes). Precooling significantly reduced rectal temperature (initially by 0.5 
± 0.2° C), mean skin temperature, heart rate and sweat rate, and increased iEMG 
activity, whereas midcooling significantly increased expired air volume and 
respiratory exchange ratio compared with control. Significant decreases in 
forehead temperature, thermal sensation, and postexercise blood prolactin 
concentration were observed in all conditions compared with control. Performance 
was improved with midcooling, whereas precooling had little or no influence. 
Midcooling may have improved performance through an attenuated inhibitory 
psychophysiological and endocrine response to the heat.

This investigation compared the effects of external pre-cooling and mid-exercise 
cooling methods on running time trial performance and associated physiological 
responses. Nine trained male runners completed familiarisation and three 
randomised 5 km running time trials on a non-motorised treadmill in the heat 
(33°C). The trials included pre-cooling by cold-water immersion (CWI), 
mid-exercise cooling by intermittent facial water spray (SPRAY), and a control 
of no cooling (CON). Temperature, cardiorespiratory, muscular activation, and 
perceptual responses were measured as well as blood concentrations of lactate 
and prolactin. Performance time was significantly faster with CWI 
(24.5 ± 2.8 min; P = 0.01) and SPRAY (24.6 ± 3.3 min; P = 0.01) compared to CON 
(25.2 ± 3.2 min). Both cooling strategies significantly (P < 0.05) reduced 
forehead temperatures and thermal sensation, and increased muscle activation. 
Only pre-cooling significantly lowered rectal temperature both pre-exercise (by 
0.5 ± 0.3°C; P < 0.01) and throughout exercise, and reduced sweat rate 
(P < 0.05). Both cooling strategies improved performance by a similar magnitude, 
and are ergogenic for athletes. The observed physiological changes suggest some 
involvement of central and psychophysiological mechanisms of performance 
improvement.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the physiological and perceptual effects of three 
precooling strategies during pre-exercise rest in athletes with a spinal cord 
injury (SCI).
DESIGN: Randomized, counterbalanced. Participants were precooled, then rested 
for 60 minutes (22.7 ± 0.2°C, 64.2 ± 2.6%RH).
SETTING: National Wheelchair Basketball Training Centre, Australia.
PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen wheelchair basketball athletes with a SCI.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were precooled through; 1) 10 minutes of 15.8°C cold 
water immersion (CWI), 2) ingestion of 6.8 g/kg-1 of slushie (S) from sports 
drink; 3) ingestion of 6.8 g/kg-1 of slushie with application of iced towels to 
the legs, torso and back/arms (ST); or 4) ingestion of 6.8 g/kg-1 of room 
temperature (22.3°C) sports drink (CON).
OUTCOME MEASURES: Core temperature (Tgi), skin temperature (Tsk), heart rate 
(HR), and thermal and gastrointestinal comfort.
RESULTS: Following CWI, a significant reduction in Tgi was observed compared to 
CON, with a greatest reduction of 1.58°C occurring 40 minutes post-cooling (95% 
CI [1.07, 2.10]). A significant reduction in Tgi following ST compared to CON 
was also observed at 20 minutes (0.56°C; [0.03, 1.09]) and 30 minutes (0.56°C; 
[0.04, 1.09]) post-cooling. Additionally, a significant interaction between 
impairment level and time was observed for Tgi and HR, demonstrating athletes 
with a higher level of impairment experienced a greater reduction in HR and 
significant decrease in rate of decline in Tgi, compared to lesser impaired 
athletes.
CONCLUSION: CWI and ST can effectively lower body temperature in athletes with a 
SCI, and may assist in tolerating warm conditions.

We evaluated the effectiveness of cold water immersion on recovery of 
performance (i. e., the ability of repetitively performing a physical test) in 
rugby players acutely and 12 h later. 8 male rugby union players (23±4.7 years; 
176.9±4.5 cm; 87.5±8.6 kg) performed a rugby-specific exercise protocol (40 min) 
followed by recovery strategies: cold water immersion (8.9±0.6°C; 9 min with 
1 min out of water, repeated twice) or control (players remained seated for 
20 min) in a random order. The players underwent performance tests 
(countermovement and 30 s continuous jumps and agility T) at 4 time points: at 
baseline, immediately after rugby-specific exercise, post-recovery strategies 
and 12 h later. The performance of the agility and countermovement jump test 
were not different between cold water immersion and control immediately post 
rugby-specific exercises and 12 h thereafter. However, the 30 s continuous jump 
test performance decreased immediately but increased 12 h later after cold water 
immersion compared with control. Perception of recovery was better in the cold 
water immersion group compared with controls post 12 h exercise. Cold water 
immersion improves 30 s continuous jump performance, total quality recovery and 
seems to be an easy and practical tool for coaches and players, especially 
during congested periods of the season when fast recovery (~12 h) for the 
following activity is essential.

CONTEXT: Exercise conducted in hot, humid environments increases the risk for 
exertional heat stroke (EHS). The current recommended treatment of EHS is 
cold-water immersion; however, limitations may require the use of alternative 
resources such as a cold shower (CS) or dousing with a hose to cool EHS 
patients.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cooling effectiveness of a CS after 
exercise-induced hyperthermia.
DESIGN: Randomized, crossover controlled study.
SETTING: Environmental chamber (temperature = 33.4°C ± 2.1°C; relative humidity 
= 27.1% ± 1.4%).
PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Seventeen participants (10 male, 7 female; 
height = 1.75 ± 0.07 m, body mass = 70.4 ± 8.7 kg, body surface area = 1.85 ± 
0.13 m(2), age range = 19-35 years) volunteered.
INTERVENTION(S): On 2 occasions, participants completed matched-intensity 
volitional exercise on an ergometer or treadmill to elevate rectal temperature 
to ≥39°C or until participant fatigue prevented continuation (reaching at least 
38.5°C). They were then either treated with a CS (20.8°C ± 0.80°C) or seated in 
the chamber (control [CON] condition) for 15 minutes.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Rectal temperature, calculated cooling rate, heart 
rate, and perceptual measures (thermal sensation and perceived muscle pain).
RESULTS: The rectal temperature (P = .98), heart rate (P = .85), thermal 
sensation (P = .69), and muscle pain (P = .31) were not different during 
exercise for the CS and CON trials (P > .05). Overall, the cooling rate was 
faster during CS (0.07°C/min ± 0.03°C/min) than during CON (0.04°C/min ± 
0.03°C/min; t16 = 2.77, P = .01). Heart-rate changes were greater during CS (45 
± 20 beats per minute) compared with CON (27 ± 10 beats per minute; t16 = 3.32, 
P = .004). Thermal sensation was reduced to a greater extent with CS than with 
CON (F3,45 = 41.12, P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Although the CS facilitated cooling rates faster than no treatment, 
clinicians should continue to advocate for accepted cooling modalities and use 
CS only if no other validated means of cooling are available.

Muscle hypertrophy occurs following increased protein synthesis, which requires 
activation of the ribosomal complex. Additionally, increased translational 
capacity via elevated ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis has also been implicated in 
resistance training-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy. The time course of 
ribosome biogenesis following resistance exercise (RE) and the impact exerted by 
differing recovery strategies remains unknown. In the present study, the 
activation of transcriptional regulators, the expression levels of pre-rRNA, and 
mature rRNA components were measured through 48 h after a single-bout RE. In 
addition, the effects of either low-intensity cycling (active recovery, ACT) or 
a cold-water immersion (CWI) recovery strategy were compared. Nine male subjects 
performed two bouts of high-load RE randomized to be followed by 10 min of 
either ACT or CWI. Muscle biopsies were collected before RE and at 2, 24, and 
48 h after RE. RE increased the phosphorylation of the p38-MNK1-eIF4E axis, an 
effect only evident with ACT recovery. Downstream, cyclin D1 protein, total 
eIF4E, upstream binding factor 1 (UBF1), and c-Myc proteins were all increased 
only after RE with ACT. This corresponded with elevated abundance of the 
pre-rRNAs (45S, ITS-28S, ITS-5.8S, and ETS-18S) from 24 h after RE with ACT. In 
conclusion, coordinated upstream signaling and activation of transcriptional 
factors stimulated pre-rRNA expression after RE. CWI, as a recovery strategy, 
markedly blunted these events, suggesting that suppressed ribosome biogenesis 
may be one factor contributing to the impaired hypertrophic response observed 
when CWI is used regularly after exercise.

Postexercise cold water immersion has been advocated to athletes as a means of 
accelerating recovery and improving performance. Given the effects of cold water 
immersion on blood flow, evaluating in vivo changes in tissue oxygenation during 
cold water immersion may help further our understanding of this recovery 
modality. This study aimed to investigate the effects of cold water immersion on 
muscle oxygenation and performance during repeated bouts of fatiguing exercise 
in a group of healthy young adults. Twenty healthy subjects performed 2 
fatiguing bouts of maximal dynamic knee extension and flexion contractions both 
concentrically on an isokinetic dynamometer with a 10-min recovery period in 
between. Subjects were randomly assigned to either a cold water immersion 
(treatment) or passive recovery (control) group. Changes in muscle oxygenation 
were monitored continuously using near-infrared spectroscopy. Muscle performance 
was measured with isokinetic dynamometry during each fatiguing bout. Skin 
temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and muscle soreness ratings were also 
assessed. Repeated measures ANOVA analysis was used to evaluate treatment 
effects. The treatment group had a significantly lower mean heart rate and lower 
skin temperature compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Cold water immersion 
attenuated a reduction in tissue oxygenation in the second fatiguing bout by 4% 
when compared with control. Muscle soreness was rated lower 1 day post-testing 
(P < 0.05). However, cold water immersion had no significant effect on muscle 
performance in subsequent exercise. As the results show that cold water 
immersion attenuated decreased tissue oxygenation in subsequent exercise 
performance, the metabolic response to exercise after cold water immersion is 
worthy of further exploration.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of cold 
water immersion during post-exercise recovery, with different durations and 
temperatures, on heart rate variability indices.
DESIGN: Hundred participants performed a protocol of jumps and a Wingate test, 
and immediately afterwards were immersed in cold water, according to the 
characteristics of each group (CG: control; G1: 5' at 9±1°C; G2: 5' at 14±1°C; 
G3: 15' at 9±1°C; G4: 15' at 14±1°C).
METHODS: Analyses were performed at baseline, during the CWI recuperative 
technique (TRec) and 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60min post-exercise. The average HRV 
indices of all RR-intervals in each analysis period (MeanRR), standard deviation 
of normal RR-intervals (SDNN), square root of the mean of the sum of the squares 
of differences between adjacent RR-intervals (RMSSD), spectral components of 
very low frequency (VLF), low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF), scatter of 
points perpendicular to the line of identity of the Poincaré Plot (SD1) and 
scatter points along the line of identity (SD2) were assessed.
RESULTS: Mean RR, VLF and LF presented an anticipated return to baseline values 
at all the intervention groups, but the same was observed for SDNN and SD2 only 
in the immersion for 15min at 14°C group (G4). In addition, G4 presented higher 
values when compared to CG.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that if the purpose of the recovery 
process is restoration of cardiac autonomic modulation, the technique is 
recommended, specifically for 15min at 14°C.

PURPOSE: To determine whether a facilitated recovery via cold-water immersion 
(CWI) after simulated rugby sevens would influence parasympathetic reactivation 
and repeated-sprint (RS) performance across 6 matches in a 2-d tournament.
METHODS: Ten male team-sport athletes completed 6 rugby sevens match simulations 
over 2 d with either postmatch passive recovery (PAS) or CWI in a randomized 
crossover design. Parasympathetic reactivation was determined via the natural 
logarithm of the square root of the mean of the sum of the squares of 
differences between adjacent R-R intervals (ln rMSSD). RS performance was 
calculated as time taken (s) to complete 6 × 30-m sprints within the first half 
of each match.
RESULTS: There were large increases in postintervention ln rMSSD between CWI and 
PAS after all matches (ES 90% CL: +1.13; ±0.21). Average heart rate (HR) during 
the RS performance task (HRAverage RS) was impaired from baseline from match 3 
onward for both conditions. However, HRAverage RS was higher with CWI than with 
PAS (ES 90% CL: 0.58; ±0.58). Peak HR during the RS performance task (HRPeak RS) 
was similarly impaired from baseline for match 3 onward during PAS and for match 
4 onward with CWI. HRPeak RS was very likely higher with CWI than with PAS (ES 
90% CL: +0.80; ±0.56). No effects of match or condition were observed for RS 
performance, although there were moderate correlations between the changes in 
HRAverage RS (r 90% CL: -0.33; ±0.14), HRPeak RS (r 90% CL: -0.38; ±0.13), and 
RS performance.
CONCLUSION: CWI facilitated cardiac parasympathetic reactivation after a 
simulated rugby sevens match. The decline in average and peak HR across matches 
was partially attenuated by CWI. This decline was moderately correlated with a 
reduction in RS performance.

We investigated functional, morphological and molecular adaptations to strength 
training exercise and cold water immersion (CWI) through two separate studies. 
In one study, 21 physically active men strength trained for 12 weeks (2 days per 
week), with either 10 min of CWI or active recovery (ACT) after each training 
session. Strength and muscle mass increased more in the ACT group than in the 
CWI group (P < 0.05). Isokinetic work (19%), type II muscle fibre 
cross-sectional area (17%) and the number of myonuclei per fibre (26%) increased 
in the ACT group (all P < 0.05), but not the CWI group. In another study, nine 
active men performed a bout of single-leg strength exercises on separate days, 
followed by CWI or ACT. Muscle biopsies were collected before and 2, 24 and 48 h 
after exercise. The number of satellite cells expressing neural cell adhesion 
molecule (NCAM) (10-30%) and paired box protein (Pax7) (20-50%) increased 24-48 
h after exercise with ACT. The number of NCAM(+) satellite cells increased 48 h 
after exercise with CWI. NCAM(+) - and Pax7(+) -positive satellite cell numbers 
were greater after ACT than after CWI (P < 0.05). Phosphorylation of p70S6 
kinase(Thr421/Ser424) increased after exercise in both conditions but was 
greater after ACT (P < 0.05). These data suggest that CWI attenuates the acute 
changes in satellite cell numbers and activity of kinases that regulate muscle 
hypertrophy, which may translate to smaller long-term training gains in muscle 
strength and hypertrophy. The use of CWI as a regular post-exercise recovery 
strategy should be reconsidered.

BACKGROUND: The haemodynamic response to Finnish sauna and subsequent cold-water 
immersion in heart failure patients is unknown.
METHODS: Haemodynamic response to two consecutive Finnish sauna (80℃) exposures, 
followed by a final head-out cold-water immersion (12℃) was measured in 37 male 
participants: chronic heart failure (n = 12, 61.8 ± 9.2 years), coronary artery 
disease (n = 13, 61.2 ± 10.6 years) and control subjects (n = 12, 60.9 ± 8.9 
years). Cardiac output was measured non-invasively with an inert gas rebreathing 
method prior to and immediately after the first sauna exposure and after 
cold-water immersion, respectively. Blood pressure was measured before, twice 
during and after sauna. The autonomic nervous system was assessed by power 
spectral analysis of heart rate variability. Total power, low-frequency and 
high-frequency components were evaluated. The low frequency/high frequency ratio 
was used as a marker of sympathovagal balance. Sauna and cold-water immersion 
were well tolerated by all subjects.
RESULTS: Cardiac output and heart rate significantly increased in all groups 
after sauna and cold-water immersion (p < 0.05), except for coronary artery 
disease patients after sauna exposure. Systolic blood pressure during sauna 
decreased significantly in all groups with a nadir after 6 min (all p < 0.05). 
Cold-water immersion significantly increased systolic blood pressure in all 
groups (p < 0.05). No change in the low/high frequency ratio was found in 
chronic heart failure patients. In coronary artery disease patients and controls 
a prolonged increase in low frequency/high frequency ratio was observed after 
the first sauna exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: Acute exposure to Finnish sauna and cold-water immersion causes 
haemodynamic alterations in chronic heart failure patients similarly to control 
subjects and in particular did not provoke an excessive increase in adrenergic 
activity or complex arrhythmias.

CONTEXT: Cryotherapy is used widely in sport and exercise medicine to manage 
acute injuries and facilitate rehabilitation. The analgesic effects of 
cryotherapy are well established; however, a potential caveat is that cooling 
tissue negatively affects neuromuscular control through delayed muscle reaction 
time. This topic is important to investigate because athletes often return to 
exercise, rehabilitation, or competitive activity immediately or shortly after 
cryotherapy.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of wet-ice application, cold-water immersion, 
and an untreated control condition on peroneus longus and tibialis anterior 
muscle reaction time during a simulated lateral ankle sprain.
DESIGN: Randomized controlled clinical trial.
SETTING: University of Hertfordshire human performance laboratory.
PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: A total of 54 physically active individuals (age 
= 20.1 ± 1.5 years, height = 1.7 ± 0.07 m, mass = 66.7 ± 5.4 kg) who had no 
injury or history of ankle sprain.
INTERVENTION(S): Wet-ice application, cold-water immersion, or an untreated 
control condition applied to the ankle for 10 minutes.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Muscle reaction time and muscle amplitude of the 
peroneus longus and tibialis anterior in response to a simulated lateral ankle 
sprain were calculated. The ankle-sprain simulation incorporated a combined 
inversion and plantar-flexion movement.
RESULTS: We observed no change in muscle reaction time or muscle amplitude after 
cryotherapy for either the peroneus longus or tibialis anterior (P > .05).
CONCLUSIONS: Ten minutes of joint cooling did not adversely affect muscle 
reaction time or muscle amplitude in response to a simulated lateral ankle 
sprain. These findings suggested that athletes can safely return to sporting 
activity immediately after icing. Further evidence showed that ice can be 
applied before ankle rehabilitation without adversely affecting dynamic 
neuromuscular control. Investigation in patients with acute ankle sprains is 
warranted to assess the clinical applicability of these interventions.

Cold water immersion (CWI) and active recovery (ACT) are frequently used as 
postexercise recovery strategies. However, the physiological effects of CWI and 
ACT after resistance exercise are not well characterized. We examined the 
effects of CWI and ACT on cardiac output (Q̇), muscle oxygenation (SmO2), blood 
volume (tHb), muscle temperature (Tmuscle), and isometric strength after 
resistance exercise. On separate days, 10 men performed resistance exercise, 
followed by 10 min CWI at 10°C or 10 min ACT (low-intensity cycling). Q̇ (7.9 ± 
2.7 l) and Tmuscle (2.2 ± 0.8°C) increased, whereas SmO2 (-21.5 ± 8.8%) and tHb 
(-10.1 ± 7.7 μM) decreased after exercise (P < 0.05). During CWI, Q̇ (-1.1 ± 0.7 
l) and Tmuscle (-6.6 ± 5.3°C) decreased, while tHb (121 ± 77 μM) increased (P < 
0.05). In the hour after CWI, Q̇ and Tmuscle remained low, while tHb also 
decreased (P < 0.05). By contrast, during ACT, Q̇ (3.9 ± 2.3 l), Tmuscle (2.2 ± 
0.5°C), SmO2 (17.1 ± 5.7%), and tHb (91 ± 66 μM) all increased (P < 0.05). In 
the hour after ACT, Tmuscle, and tHb remained high (P < 0.05). Peak isometric 
strength during 10-s maximum voluntary contractions (MVCs) did not change 
significantly after CWI, whereas it decreased after ACT (-30 to -45 Nm; P < 
0.05). Muscle deoxygenation time during MVCs increased after ACT (P < 0.05), but 
not after CWI. Muscle reoxygenation time after MVCs tended to increase after CWI 
(P = 0.052). These findings suggest first that hemodynamics and muscle 
temperature after resistance exercise are dependent on ambient temperature and 
metabolic demands with skeletal muscle, and second, that recovery of strength 
after resistance exercise is independent of changes in hemodynamics and muscle 
temperature.

Immediate treatment with cold water immersion (CWI) is the gold standard for 
exertional heatstroke. In the field, however, treatment is often delayed due to 
delayed paramedic response and/or inaccurate diagnosis. We examined the effect 
of treatment (reduction of rectal temperature to 37.5 °C) delays of 5, 20, and 
40 min on core cooling rates in eight exertionally heat-stressed (40.0 °C rectal 
temperature) individuals. We found that rectal temperature was elevated above 
baseline (P < 0.05) at the end of all delay periods (5 min: 40.08 ± 0.32; 
20 min: 39.92 ± 0.40; 40 min: 39.57 ± 0.29 °C). Mean arterial pressure was 
reduced (P < 0.05) below baseline (92 ± 1.8 mm Hg) after all delay periods 
(5 min: 75 ± 2.6; 20 min: 74 ± 1.7; 40 min: 70 ± 2.1 mm Hg; P > 0.05). Rectal 
core cooling rates were similar among conditions (5 min: 0.20 ± 0.01; 20 min: 
0.17 ± 0.02; 40 min: 0.17 ± 0.01 °C/min; P > 0.05). The rectal temperature 
afterdrop following CWI was similar across conditions (5 min: 35.95; 20 min: 
35.61; 40 min: 35.87 °C; P > 0.05). We conclude that the effectiveness of 2 °C 
CWI as a treatment for exertional heat stress remains high even when applied 
with a delay of 40 min. Therefore, our results support that CWI is the most 
appropriate treatment for exertional heatstroke as it is capable of quickly 
reversing hyperthermia even when treatment is commenced with a significant 
delay.

The aim of the study was to determine the effect of a 5 min head-out ice-cold 
water bath on the oxidant-antioxidant balance in response to exercise. The 
crossover study included the subjects (n = 24; aged 28.7 ± 7.3 years) who 
performed two identical stationary cycling bouts for 30 min and recovered for 10 
min at room temperature (RT = 20°C; session 1) or in a pool with ice-cold water 
(ICW = 3°C, 5 min immersion; session 2). The concentration of thiobarbituric 
acid reactive substances (TBARS) in blood plasma (TBARSpl) and erythrocytes 
(TBARSer) and the erythrocytic activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase 
(CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were measured three times during each of 
the two study sessions: before the exercise (baseline) and 20 and 40 min after 
the appropriate recovery session. Lower concentration of TBARSpl 40 min after 
postexercise recovery in ICW was revealed as compared with that after recovery 
at RT (P < 0.05). Moreover, a statistically significant postexercise increase in 
the TBARSpl and TBARSer concentrations was found (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, resp.). 
A short-term ice-cold water bath decreases postexercise lipid peroxidation.

This study examined the effects of regular post-exercise cold application on 
muscular and vascular adaptations induced by moderate-intensity resistance 
training. 14 male subjects participated in resistance training: 5 sets of 8 
wrist-flexion exercises at workload of 70-80% of the single repetition maximum, 
3 times a week for 6 weeks. 7 subjects immersed their experimental forearms in 
cold water (10±1°C) for 20 min after wrist-flexion exercises (cooled group), and 
the other 7 served as control subjects (noncooled group). Measurements were 
taken before and after the training period; wrist-flexor thickness, 
brachial-artery diameter, maximal muscle strength, and local muscle endurance 
were measured in upper extremities. Wrist-flexor thicknesses of the experimental 
arms increased after training in both groups, but the extent of each increase 
was significantly less in the cooled group compared with the noncooled group. 
Maximal muscle strength and brachial-artery diameter did not increase in the 
cooled group, while they increased in the noncooled group. Local muscle 
endurance increased in both groups, but the increase in the cooled group tended 
to be lower compared to the noncooled group. Regular post-exercise cold 
application to muscles might attenuate muscular and vascular adaptations to 
resistance training.

Here, we address the question of why some people have a greater chance of 
surviving and/or better resistance to cold-related-injuries in prolonged 
exposure to acute cold environments than do others, despite similar physical 
characteristics. The main aim of this study was to compare physiological and 
psychological reactions between people who exhibited fast cooling (FC; n = 20) 
or slow cooling (SC; n = 20) responses to cold water immersion. Individuals in 
whom the T(re) decreased to a set point of 35.5 °C before the end of the 170-min 
cooling time were indicated as the FC group; individuals in whom the T(re) did 
not decrease to the set point of 35.5 °C before the end of the 170-min cooling 
time were classified as the SC group. Cold stress was induced using intermittent 
immersion in bath water at 14 °C. Motor (spinal and supraspinal reflexes, 
voluntary and electrically induced skeletal muscle contraction force) and 
cognitive (executive function, short term memory, short term spatial 
recognition) performance, immune variables (neutrophils, leucocytes, 
lymphocytes, monocytes, IL-6, TNF-α), markers of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal 
axis activity (cortisol, corticosterone) and autonomic nervous system activity 
(epinephrine, norepinephrine) were monitored. The data obtained in this study 
suggest that the response of the FC group to cooling vs the SC group response 
was more likely an insulative-hypothermic response and that the SC vs the FC 
group displayed a metabolic-insulative response. The observations that an 
exposure time to 14 °C cold water--which was nearly twice as short (96-min vs 
170-min) with a greater rectal temperature decrease (35.5 °C vs 36.2 °C) in the 
FC group compared with the SC group--induces similar responses of motor, 
cognitive, and blood stress markers were novel. The most important finding is 
that subjects with a lower cold-strain-index (SC group) showed stimulation of 
some markers of innate immunity and suppression of markers of specific immunity.

The purpose of this study was to identify the influence of cryotherapy on lower 
extremity running biomechanics. Twenty-six healthy male volunteers were 
randomised into two intervention groups: cold water (cold water at ~11°C) or 
tepid water (tepid water at ~26°C). They were required to run at 4.0 ± 0.2 m · 
s(-1) before and after they underwent water immersion for 20 min. Differences 
between pre- and post-intervention were used to compare the influence of water 
intervention during running. Peak joint angles, peak joint moments, peak ground 
reaction forces (GRF) and contact time (CT) were calculated using 
three-dimensional gait analysis. Independent t-tests were applied with a 
significant alpha level set at 0.05. Decreased peak propulsive and vertical GRF, 
decreased plantarflexion moments, increased hip flexion angle and longer CT were 
observed following cold water immersion. Although cold water immersion 
(cryotherapy) affected the running movement, none of the alterations have been 
related to running biomechanical patterns associated with injuries. Therefore, 
our results indicated that cold water immersion appears safe prior to running 
activities.

We investigated the effect of cold water immersion (CWI) on the recovery of 
muscle function and physiological responses after high-intensity resistance 
exercise. Using a randomized, cross-over design, 10 physically active men 
performed high-intensity resistance exercise followed by one of two recovery 
interventions: 1) 10 min of CWI at 10°C or 2) 10 min of active recovery 
(low-intensity cycling). After the recovery interventions, maximal muscle 
function was assessed after 2 and 4 h by measuring jump height and isometric 
squat strength. Submaximal muscle function was assessed after 6 h by measuring 
the average load lifted during 6 sets of 10 squats at 80% of 1 repetition 
maximum. Intramuscular temperature (1 cm) was also recorded, and venous blood 
samples were analyzed for markers of metabolism, vasoconstriction, and muscle 
damage. CWI did not enhance recovery of maximal muscle function. However, during 
the final three sets of the submaximal muscle function test, participants lifted 
a greater load (P < 0.05, Cohen's effect size: 1.3, 38%) after CWI compared with 
active recovery. During CWI, muscle temperature decreased ∼7°C below 
postexercise values and remained below preexercise values for another 35 min. 
Venous blood O2 saturation decreased below preexercise values for 1.5 h after 
CWI. Serum endothelin-1 concentration did not change after CWI, whereas it 
decreased after active recovery. Plasma myoglobin concentration was lower, 
whereas plasma IL-6 concentration was higher after CWI compared with active 
recovery. These results suggest that CWI after resistance exercise allows 
athletes to complete more work during subsequent training sessions, which could 
enhance long-term training adaptations.

inflammatory response and functional recovery from high-intensity sprint 
exercise.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of different 
cold-water immersion (CWI) protocols on the inflammatory response to and 
functional recovery from high-intensity exercise.
METHODS: Eight healthy recreationally active males completed five trials of a 
high-intensity intermittent sprint protocol followed by a randomly assigned 
recovery condition: 1 of 4 CWI protocols (CWI-10 min × 20 °C, CWI-30 min × 20 
°C, CWI-10 min × 10 °C, or CWI-30 min × 10 °C) versus passive rest. Circulating 
mediators of the inflammatory response were measured from EDTA plasma taken 
pre-exercise (baseline), immediately post-exercise, and at 2, 24, and 48 h 
post-exercise. Ratings of perceived soreness and impairment were noted on a 
10-pt Likert scale, and squat jump and drop jump were performed at these time 
points.
RESULTS: IL-6, IL-8, and MPO increased significantly from baseline immediately 
post-exercise in all conditions. IL-6 remained elevated from baseline at 2 h in 
the CWI-30 min × 20 °C, CWI-10 min × 10 °C, and CWI-30 min × 10 °C conditions, 
while further increases were observed for IL-8 and MPO in the CWI-30 min × 20 °C 
and CWI-30 min × 10 °C conditions. Squat jump and drop jump height were 
significantly lower in all conditions immediately post-exercise and at 2 h. Drop 
jump remained below baseline at 24 and 48 h in the CON and CWI-10 min × 20 °C 
conditions only, while squat jump height returned to baseline in all conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: Cold-water immersion appears to facilitate restoration of muscle 
performance in a stretch-shortening cycle, but not concentric power. These 
changes do not appear to be related to inflammatory modulation. CWI protocols of 
excessive duration may actually exacerbate the concentration of cytokines in 
circulation post-exercise; however, the origin of the circulating cytokines is 
not necessarily skeletal muscle.

PURPOSE: To assess the impact of between-training-sessions recovery strategies 
(passive [PAS], active [ACT], cold-water immersion [CWI], and ingestion of a 
recovery drink [NUTR]) on maximal cycling performance, perceptions of 
delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS), and fatigue in world-class BMX riders.
METHODS: Eleven elite BMX athletes, members of the French national team (top 
country in the 2011 international ranking, 4 medals at the 2012 World 
Championships, top European country), participated in the study, which involved 
standardized training periods. Athletes performed 3 maximal-sprint power tests: 
the first day of the week before the training session and before and after 
training on the third day of the week (D3). The recovery strategy was randomly 
assigned to each participant on day 2 immediately after the last training period 
of the day. Perceptions of DOMS and general fatigue were recorded on D3.
RESULTS: After training on D3, the decrease in maximal-sprint power (Pmax) was 
significantly greater for PAS than with CWI (P=.02) and NUTR (P=.018). Similar 
results were found with ACT (vs CWI P=.044, and vs NUTR P=.042). Self-reported 
DOMS and fatigue were significantly greater after PAS than after other 
strategies.
CONCLUSIONS: For elite BMX riders, between training days, nutritional and/or CWI 
recovery strategies appear to be best for reducing muscle fatigue and increasing 
the capacity to withstand the training schedule.

Impact of cool and warm water immersion on 50-m sprint performance and lactate 
recovery in swimmers.

Sciences, University of Athens, Athens, Greece - esoultan@phed.uoa.gr.

AIM: The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of recovery by cool 
or warm water immersion, between two 50-m sprints on performance determinants 
and lactate responses in simulated competition conditions.
METHODS: Eight well-trained sprint swimmers (21 ± 2.4 years), after an initial 
warm-up and 15-minutes recovery with no immersion (NI), performed a maximal 50 m 
sprint. A second 50 m sprint followed after a second 15-minute recovery period 
with passive immersion in either warm (WI, 30 °C), or cool water (CI, 26.7 °C). 
In a crossover design, all subjects repeated the trial 48 hours later utilizing 
the alternate immersion temperature. During the 50-m sprints, time and stroke 
characteristics were recorded. Blood lactate and heart rates were measured 
before and after the trials. Strength and flexibility were recorded before and 
after immersions and ratings of perceived exertion were evaluated.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in time, event velocity, or 
stroke rate, between any of the trials. With WI, a significant reduction of 
handgrip strength was observed (P=0.029) with lower ratings of perceived 
exertion observed after the sprint. Higher resting lactate levels were recorded, 
prior to swimming, after both the 15-minute WI and CI water recoveries (P<0.01) 
as compared to NI. No correlation was observed between swim performance times 
and starting or peak lactate levels, with any type of recovery intervention 
(R2=0.047; slope NS from zero).
CONCLUSION: Recovery by cool (26.7 °C) or warm (30 °C) water immersion does not 
affect velocity or stroke characteristics in a 50-m freestyle sprint, even when 
widely employed performance related determinants such as resting lactate levels 
and perceived exertion are not optimal.

Firefighters are exposed to hot environments, which results in elevated core 
temperatures. Rapidly reducing core temperatures will likely increase safety as 
firefighters are redeployed to subsequent operational tasks. This study 
investigated the effectiveness of cold-water immersion (CWI) and iced-slush 
ingestion (SLUSH) to cool firefighters post-incident. Seventy-four Australian 
firefighters (mean ± SD age: 38.9 ± 9.0 years) undertook a simulated search and 
rescue task in a heat chamber (105 ± 5 °C). Testing involved two 20-min work 
cycles separated by a 10-min rest period. Ambient temperature during recovery 
periods was 19.3 ± 2.7 °C. Participants were randomly assigned one of three 
15-min cooling protocols: (i) CWI, 15 °C to umbilicus; (ii) SLUSH, 7 g·kg(-1) 
body weight; or (iii) seated rest (CONT). Core temperature and strength were 
measured pre- and postsimulation and directly after cooling. Mean temperatures 
for all groups reached 38.9 ± 0.9 °C at the conclusion of the second work task. 
Both CWI and SLUSH delivered cooling rates in excess of CONT (0.093 and 0.092 
compared with 0.058 °C·min(-1)) and reduced temperatures to baseline 
measurements within the 15-min cooling period. Grip strength was not negatively 
impacted by either SLUSH or CONT. CWI and SLUSH provide evidence-based 
alternatives to passive recovery and forearm immersion protocols currently 
adopted by many fire services. To maximise the likelihood of adoption, we 
recommend SLUSH ingestion as a practical and effective cooling strategy for 
post-incident cooling of firefighters in temperate regions.

Mediators of monocyte migration, complement receptor-3 (CR3), and chemokine 
ligand-4 (CCL4) were measured in response to recovery modalities following 
resistance exercise. Thirty resistance-trained men (23.1 ± 2.9 y; 175.2 ± 7.1 
cm; 82.1 ± 8.4 kg) were given neuromuscular electric stimulation (NMES), cold 
water immersion (CWI), or control (CON) treatments immediately following 
resistance exercise. Blood samples were obtained preexercise (PRE), immediately 
(IP), 30 minutes (30 P), 24 hours (24 H), and 48 hours (48 H) after exercise for 
measurement of circulating CCL4 and CR3 expression on CD14+ monocytes, by assay 
and flow cytometry. Circulating CCL4 showed no consistent changes. Inferential 
analysis indicated that CR3 expression was likely greater in CON at 30 P than 
NMES (90.0%) or CWI (86.8%). NMES was likely lower than CON at 24 H (92.9%) and 
very likely lower at 48 H (98.7%). Expression of CR3 following CWI was very 
likely greater than CON (96.5%) at 24 H. The proportion of CR3+ monocytes was 
likely greater following CWI than NMES (85.8%) or CON (85.2%) at 24 H. The 
change in proportion of CR3+ monocytes was likely (86.4%) greater following NMES 
than CON from IP to 30 P. The increased expression of CR3 and increased 
proportion of CR3+ monocytes following CWI at 24 H indicate a potentially 
improved ability for monocyte adhesion to the endothelium, possibly improving 
phagocytosis of damaged tissues.

Excessive or persistent proinflammatory cytokine production plays a central role 
in autoimmune diseases. Acute activation of the sympathetic nervous system 
attenuates the innate immune response. However, both the autonomic nervous 
system and innate immune system are regarded as systems that cannot be 
voluntarily influenced. Herein, we evaluated the effects of a training program 
on the autonomic nervous system and innate immune response. Healthy volunteers 
were randomized to either the intervention (n = 12) or control group (n = 12). 
Subjects in the intervention group were trained for 10 d in meditation (third 
eye meditation), breathing techniques (i.a., cyclic hyperventilation followed by 
breath retention), and exposure to cold (i.a., immersions in ice cold water). 
The control group was not trained. Subsequently, all subjects underwent 
experimental endotoxemia (i.v. administration of 2 ng/kg Escherichia coli 
endotoxin). In the intervention group, practicing the learned techniques 
resulted in intermittent respiratory alkalosis and hypoxia resulting in 
profoundly increased plasma epinephrine levels. In the intervention group, 
plasma levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 increased more rapidly 
after endotoxin administration, correlated strongly with preceding epinephrine 
levels, and were higher. Levels of proinflammatory mediators TNF-α, IL-6, and 
IL-8 were lower in the intervention group and correlated negatively with IL-10 
levels. Finally, flu-like symptoms were lower in the intervention group. In 
conclusion, we demonstrate that voluntary activation of the sympathetic nervous 
system results in epinephrine release and subsequent suppression of the innate 
immune response in humans in vivo. These results could have important 
implications for the treatment of conditions associated with excessive or 
persistent inflammation, such as autoimmune diseases.

BACKGROUND: Cold Water Immersion (CWI) is commonly used to manage delayed onset 
muscle soreness (DOMS) resulting from exercise. Scientific evidence for an 
optimal dose of CWI is lacking and athletes continue to use a range of a 
treatment protocols and water temperatures.
OBJECTIVES: To compare the effectiveness of four different water immersion 
protocols and a passive control intervention in the management of DOMS.
DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial with blinded outcome assessment.
SETTING: University Research Laboratory.
PARTICIPANTS: 50 healthy participants with laboratory induced DOMS randomised to 
one of five groups: Short contrast immersion (1 min 38 °C/1 min 10 °C × 3), 
Short intermittent CWI (1 min × 3 at 10 °C); 10 min CWI in 10 °C; 10 min CWI in 
6 °C; or control (seated rest).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: muscle soreness, active range of motion, pain on stretch, 
muscle strength and serum creatine kinase.
RESULTS: 10 min of CWI in 6 °C was associated with the lowest levels of muscle 
soreness and pain on stretch however values were not statistically different to 
any of the other groups. There were no statistically significant differences 
between groups for any other outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Altering the treatment duration, water temperature or dosage of post 
exercise water immersion had minimal effect on outcomes relating to DOMS.

PURPOSE: Despite a general lack of understanding of the underlying mechanisms, 
cold water immersion (CWI) is widely used by athletes for recovery. This study 
examined the physiological merit of CWI for recovery from high-intensity 
exercise by investigating if the placebo effect is responsible for any acute 
performance or psychological benefits.
METHODS: Thirty males (mean ± SD: age, 24 ± 5 yr; VO2 peak, 51.1 ± 7.0 mL · 
kg(-1) · min(-1)) performed an acute high-intensity interval training session, 
comprised of 4 × 30-s sprints, immediately followed by one of the following 
three 15-min recovery conditions: CWI (10.3°C ± 0.2°C), thermoneutral water 
immersion placebo (TWP) (34.7°C ± 0.1°C), or thermoneutral water immersion 
control (TWI) (34.7°C ± 0.1°C). An intramuscular thermistor was inserted during 
exercise and recovery to record muscle temperature. Swelling (thigh girth), pain 
threshold/tolerance, interleukin 6 concentration, and total leukocyte, 
neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts were recorded at baseline, postexercise, 
postrecovery, and 1, 24, and 48 h postexercise. A maximal voluntary isometric 
contraction (MVC) of the quadriceps was performed at the same time points, with 
the exception of postexercise. Self-assessments of readiness for exercise, 
fatigue, vigor, sleepiness, pain, and belief of recovery effectiveness were also 
completed.
RESULTS: Leg strength after the MVC and ratings of readiness for exercise, pain, 
and vigor were significantly impaired in TWI compared with those in CWI and TWP 
which were similar to each other.
CONCLUSIONS: A recovery placebo administered after an acute high-intensity 
interval training session is superior in the recovery of muscle strength over 48 
h as compared with TWI and is as effective as CWI. This can be attributed to 
improved ratings of readiness for exercise, pain, and vigor, suggesting that the 
commonly hypothesized physiological benefits surrounding CWI are at least partly 
placebo related.

The aim of the current study was to examine the effects of cold water immersion 
(CWI) with and without the free acid form of β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (HMB-FA) 
on markers of muscle damage following acute lower body resistance exercise. 
Forty recreationally resistance-trained men (22.3 ± 2.4 years) were randomly 
divided into one of the four groups: (1) Placebo (PL); (2) HMB-FA; (3) 
HMB-FA-CWI; (4) PL-CWI. HMB-FA groups ingested 3 g day(-1) and CWI groups 
submersed their lower body into 10-12 °C water for 10-min post-exercise. No 
differences between groups were observed for CK; however, PL-CWI had 
significantly greater elevations in myoglobin 30-min post-exercise compared to 
HMB-FA (p = 0.009) and PL (p = 0.005), and HMB-FA-CWI was significantly greater 
than HMB-FA (p = 0.046) and PL (p = 0.028). No differences between groups were 
observed for IL-6 and IL-10, although CRP was significantly greater 24-h 
post-exercise for PL-CWI compared to HMB-FA-CWI (p = 0.02) and HMB-FA (p = 
0.046). Only HMB-FA-CWI showed significantly (p = 0.02) greater improvements in 
average power per repetition. CWI appeared to elevate myoglobin compared to 
other groups, while HMB-FA may have attenuated the increase in CRP when combined 
with CWI. Nevertheless, HMB-FA or CWI treatments did not appear to provide 
benefit over PL for recovery. Instead, the combination of CWI and HMB-FA 
improved performance recovery compared to other groups.

In light of the wide use of cryotherapy and its potential negative effects on 
postural stability, little is known about how postural sway is affected, 
particularly when the whole lower limb is immersed. The purpose of this study 
was to analyze the influence of cryotherapy on postural sway in healthy males. 
Twenty-six subjects were randomly assigned into two intervention groups: control 
(tepid water at ∼26°C) or ice (cold water at ∼11°C). Postural sway was measured 
through the center of pressure (COP) position while they stood on a force plate 
during bipedal (70 s) and unipedal (40 s) conditions before and after the 
subjects were immersed in a water tub up to the umbilical level for 20 min. COP 
standard deviation (SD) and COP velocity were analyzed in the anterior-posterior 
(AP) and medial-lateral (ML) directions. Statistical analysis showed that in the 
bipedal condition cryotherapy increased the COP SD and COP velocity in the ML 
direction. During the unipedal condition, a higher COP velocity in the AP and ML 
directions was also reported. Our findings indicate that cryotherapy by 
immersing the whole lower limb should be used with caution before engaging in 
challenging postural control activities.

Effect of run training and cold-water immersion on subsequent cycle training

The purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of cold-water immersion 
(CWI) on physiological, psychological, and biochemical markers of recovery and 
subsequent cycling performance after intensive run training. Seven 
high-performance male triathletes (age: 28.6 ± 7.1 years; cycling VO2peak: 73.4 
± 10.2 ml · kg(-1) · min(-1)) completed 2 trials in a randomized crossover 
design consisting of 7 × 5-minute running intervals at 105% of individual 
anaerobic threshold followed by either CWI (10 ± 0.5° C) or thermoneutral water 
immersion (TNI; 34 ± 0.5° C). Subjects immersed their legs in water 5 times for 
60 seconds with 60-second passive rest between each immersion. Nine hours after 
immersion, inflammatory and muscle damage markers, and perceived recovery 
measures were obtained before the subjects completed a 5-minute maximal cycling 
test followed by a high-quality cycling interval training set (6 × 5-minute 
intervals). Power output, heart rate, blood lactate (La), and rating of 
perceived exertion (RPE) were also recorded during the cycling time-trial and 
interval set. Performance was enhanced (change, ± 90% confidence limits) in the 
CWI condition during the cycling interval training set (power output [W · 
kg(-1)], 2.1 ± 1.7%, La [mmol · L(-1)], 18 ± 18.1%, La:RPE, 19.8 ± 17.5%). 
However, there was an unclear effect of CWI on 5-minute maximal cycling 
time-trial performance, and there was no significant influence on perceptual 
measures of fatigue/recovery, despite small to moderate effects. The effect of 
CWI on the biochemical markers was mostly unclear, however, there was a 
substantial effect for interleukin-10 (20 ± 13.4%). These results suggest that 
compared with TNI, CWI may be effective for enhancing cycling interval training 
performance after intensive interval-running training.

CONTEXT: Resistance training is a common form of exercise for competitive and 
recreational athletes. Enhancing recovery from resistance training may improve 
the muscle-remodeling processes, stimulating a faster return to peak 
performance.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of 2 different recovery modalities, 
neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) and cold-water immersion (CWI), on 
performance and biochemical and ultrasonographic measures.
PARTICIPANTS: Thirty resistance-trained men (23.1 ± 2.9 y, 175.2 ± 7.1 cm, 82.1 
± 8.4 kg) were randomly assigned to NMES, CWI, or control (CON).
DESIGN AND SETTING: All participants completed a high-volume lower-body 
resistance-training workout on d 1 and returned to the human performance 
laboratory 24 (24H) and 48 h (48 H) postexercise for follow-up testing.
MEASURES: Blood samples were obtained preexercise (PRE) and immediately (IP), 30 
min (30 P), 24 h (24H), and 48 h (48 H) post. Subjects were examined for 
performance changes in the squat exercise (total repetitions and average power 
per repetition), biomarkers of inflammation, and changes in cross-sectional area 
and echo intensity (EI) of the rectus femoris (RF) and vastus lateralis muscles.
RESULTS: No differences between groups were observed in the number of 
repetitions (P = .250; power: P = .663). Inferential-based analysis indicated 
that increases in C-reactive protein concentrations were likely increased by a 
greater magnitude after CWI compared with CON, while NMES possibly decreased 
more than CON from IP to 24H. Increases in interleukin-10 concentrations between 
IP and 30 P were likely greater in CWI than NMES but not different from CON. 
Inferential-based analysis of RF EI indicated a likely decrease for CWI between 
IP and 48 H. No other differences between groups were noted in any other 
muscle-architecture measures.
CONCLUSIONS: Results indicated that CWI induced greater increases in pro- and 
anti-inflammatory markers, while decreasing RF EI, suggesting that CWI may be 
effective in enhancing short-term muscle recovery after high-volume bouts of 
resistance exercise.

the heat.

PURPOSE: To determine the effect of active recovery (AR), passive rest (PR), and 
cold-water immersion (CWI) after 90 min of intensive cycling on a subsequent 
12-min time trial (TT2) and the applied pacing strategy in TT2.
METHODS: After a maximal test and familiarization trial, 9 trained male subjects 
(age 22 ± 3 y, VO2max 62.1 ± 5.3 mL · min-1 · kg-1) performed 3 experimental 
trials in the heat (30°C). Each trial consisted of 2 exercise tasks separated by 
1 h. The first was a 60-min constant-load trial at 55% of the maximal power 
output followed by a 30-min time trial (TT1). The second comprised a 12-min 
simulated time trial (TT2). After TT1, AR, PR, or CWI was applied for 15 min.
RESULTS: No significant TT2 performance differences were observed, but a 
1-sample t test (within each condition) revealed different pacing strategies 
during TT2. CWI resulted in an even pacing strategy, while AR and PR resulted in 
a gradual decline of power output after the onset of TT2 (P ≤ .046). During 
recovery, AR and CWI showed a trend toward faster blood lactate ([BLa]) removal, 
but during TT2 significantly higher [BLa] was only observed after CWI compared 
with PR (P = .011).
CONCLUSION: The pacing strategy during subsequent cycling performance in the 
heat is influenced by the application of different postexercise recovery 
interventions. Although power was not significantly altered between groups, CWI 
enabled a differently shaped power profile, likely due to decreased thermal 
strain.

Auckland, Auckland, NEW ZEALAND.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the influence of localized muscle 
cooling on postexercise vascular, metabolic, and mitochondrial-related gene 
expression.
METHODS: Nine physically active males performed 30 min of continuous running at 
70% of their maximal aerobic velocity, followed by intermittent running to 
exhaustion at 100% maximal aerobic velocity. After exercise, subjects immersed 
one leg in a cold water bath (10°C, COLD) to the level of their gluteal fold for 
15 min. The contralateral leg remained outside the water bath and served as 
control (CON). Core body temperature was monitored throughout the experiment, 
whereas muscle biopsies and muscle temperature (Tm) measurements were obtained 
from the vastus lateralis before exercise (PRE), immediately postexercise 
(POST-EX, Tm only), immediately after cooling, and 3 h postexercise (POST-3H).
RESULTS: Exercise significantly increased core body temperature (PRE, 37.1°C ± 
0.4°C vs POST-EX, 39.3°C ± 0.5°C, P < 0.001) and Tm in both CON (PRE, 33.9°C ± 
0.7°C vs POST-EX, 39.1°C ± 0.5°C) and COLD legs (PRE, 34.2°C ± 0.9°C vs POST-EX, 
39.4°C ± 0.3°C), respectively (P < 0.001). After cooling, Tm was significantly 
lower in COLD (28.9°C ± 2.3°C vs 37.0°C ± 0.8°C, P < 0.001) whereas PGC-1α 
messenger RNA expression was significantly higher in COLD at POST-3H (P = 
0.014). Significant time effects were evident for changes in vascular 
endothelial growth factor (P = 0.038) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (P = 
0.019) expression. However, no significant condition effects between COLD and 
CON were evident for changes in both vascular endothelial growth factor and 
neuronal nitric oxide synthase expressions.
CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that an acute postexercise cooling intervention 
enhances the gene expression of PGC-1α and may therefore provide a valuable 
strategy to enhance exercise-induced mitochondrial biogenesis.

Sciences (DHfPG), Saarbrücken, Germany; and 4Institute of Sports and Preventive 
Medicine, Saarland University, Saarbrücken, Germany.

Several studies analyzed the effectiveness of cold-water immersion (CWI) to 
support recovery after strenuous exercise, but the overall results seem to be 
conflicting. Most of these studies analyzed only short-term recovery effects, 
whereas the adaptational aspect has been widely neglected. Therefore, we 
analyzed the effects of repeated cooling after training sessions (CWI) on 
adaptations to strength training. Seventeen trained male students volunteered 
the study. After a 2-week familiarization period, a pretest (T1) of 1 repetition 
maximum (RM) and 12RM was conducted followed by the 5-week strength training 
period (within-subject design). After the posttest (T2) and a 2-week detraining 
period, a retention test (T3) was carried out. Directly after each training 
session, CWI was applied for 1 randomly assigned leg. Cooling consisted of 3 
4-minute intervals with a 30-second rest period. The other leg was not cooled. A 
significant increase in 1RM and 12RM from baseline to T2 and T3 (p < 0.001), 
respectively, and a further significant increase in 12RM from T2 to T3 (p ≤ 
0.05) were observed. In addition, a tendency for a large leg effect with higher 
values for the ""control leg"" in both parameters (p = 0.08 each) and a moderate 
time × leg interaction in favor of the control leg was found (1RM: p = 0.11; 
12RM: p = 0.09). The percentage change differences between both conditions were 
1.6% for the increase in 1RM from T1 to T2 and 2.0% from T1 to T3 in favor of 
the control leg. Long-term strength training adaptations in trained subjects can 
be negatively affected by CWI. However, effects were small, and the practical 
relevance relative to possible recovery effects needs to be considered in a 
sports practical setting.

Contrast water therapy is a popular recovery modality in sport; however, 
appropriate facilities can often be difficult to access. Therefore, the present 
study examined the use of contrast showers as an alternative to contrast water 
therapy for team sport recovery. In a randomized, crossover design, 10 elite 
female netball athletes (mean ± SD: age, 20 ± 0.6 years; height, 1.82 ± 0.05 m; 
body mass, 77.0 ± 9.3 kg) completed 3 experimental trials of a netball specific 
circuit followed by one of the following 14-minute recovery interventions: (a) 
contrast water therapy (alternating 1 minute 38° C and 1 minute 15° C water 
immersion), (b) contrast showers (alternating 1 minute 38° C and 1 minute 18° C 
showers), or (c) passive recovery (seated rest in 20° C). Repeated agility, skin 
and core temperature, and perception scales were measured before, immediately 
after, 5 and 24 hours postexercise. No significant differences in repeated 
agility were evident between conditions at any time point. No significant 
differences in core temperature were observed between conditions; however, skin 
temperature was significantly lower immediately after contrast water therapy and 
contrast showers compared with the passive condition. Overall perceptions of 
recovery were superior after contrast water therapy and contrast showers 
compared with passive recovery. The findings indicate contrast water therapy and 
contrast showers did not accelerate physical recovery in elite netballers after 
a netball specific circuit; however, the psychological benefit from both 
interventions should be considered when determining the suitability of these 
recovery interventions in team sport.

Auckland University of Technology, Auckland, NEW ZEALAND.

PURPOSE: Cold water immersion (CWI) may be beneficial for acute recovery from 
exercise, but it may impair long-term performance by attenuating the stimuli 
responsible for adaptation to training. We compared effects of CWI and passive 
rest on cycling performance during a simulated cycling grand tour.
METHODS: Thirty-four male endurance-trained competitive cyclists were randomized 
to CWI for four times per week for 15 min at 15°C or control (passive recovery) 
groups for 7 d of baseline training, 21 d of intensified training, and an 11-d 
taper. Criteria for completion of training and testing were satisfied by 10 
cyclists in the CWI group (maximal aerobic power, 5.13 ± 0.21 W·kg; mean ± SD) 
and 11 in the control group (5.01 ± 0.41 W·kg). Each week, cyclists completed a 
high-intensity interval cycling test and two 4-min bouts separated by 30 min. 
CWI was performed four times per week for 15 min at 15°C.
RESULTS: Between baseline and taper, cyclists in the CWI group had an unclear 
change in overall 4-min power relative to control (2.7% ± 5.7%), although mean 
power in the second effort relative to the first was likely higher for the CWI 
group relative to control (3.0% ± 3.8%). The change in 1-s maximum mean sprint 
power in the CWI group was likely beneficial compared with control (4.4% ± 
4.2%). Differences between groups for the 10-min time trial were unclear (-0.4% 
± 4.3%).
CONCLUSION: Although some effects of CWI on performance were unclear, data from 
this study do not support recent speculation that CWI is detrimental to 
performance after increased training load in competitive cyclists.

The inflammatory response to muscle-damaging exercise requires monocyte 
mobilization and adhesion. Complement receptor type 3 (CR3) and macrophage 
inflammatory protein (MIP)-1β enables monocyte recruitment, adhesion, and 
subsequent infiltration into damaged muscle tissue. The purpose of this study 
was to examine the effects of cold water immersion (CWI) and/or 
β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate free acid (HMB-FA) on CR3 expression and MIP-1β 
concentration after four sets of up to 10 repetitions of squat, dead lift, and 
split squat exercises at 70-80% 1-repetition maximum. Thirty-nine 
resistance-trained men (22.2 ± 2.5 yr) were randomly divided into four groups: 
1) placebo (PL), 2) HMB-FA, 3) HMB-FA-CWI, and 4) PL-CWI. The HMB-FA groups 
ingested 3 g/day, and CWI groups were submersed into 10-12°C water for 10 min 
after exercise. Blood was sampled at baseline (PRE), immediately post- (IP), 30 
min post- (30P), 24 h post- (24P), and 48 h post (48P)-exercise. Circulating 
MIP-1β was assayed and CR3 expression on CD14+ monocytes was measured by flow 
cytometry. Without treatment, CR3 expression significantly elevated at 30P 
compared with other time points (P = 0.030-0.047). HMB-FA significantly elevated 
the percentage of monocytes expressing CR3 between IP and 24P (P = 0.046) and 
between IP and 48P (P = 0.046). No time effect was observed for MIP-1β 
concentration. The recovery modalities showed to attenuate the rise in CR3 
following exercise. Additionally, supplementation with HMB-FA significantly 
elevated the percentage of monocytes expressing CR3 during recovery. Although 
the time course that inflammatory responses are most beneficial remains to be 
determined, recovery modalities may alter immune cell mobilization and adhesion 
mechanisms during tissue recovery.

PURPOSE: The implications of undertaking DXA scans using best practice protocols 
(subjects fasted and rested) or a less precise but more practical protocol in 
assessing chronic changes in body composition following training and a 
specialized recovery technique were investigated.
METHODS: Twenty-one male cyclists completed an overload training program, in 
which they were randomized to four sessions per week of either cold water 
immersion therapy or control groups. Whole-body DXA scans were undertaken with 
best practice protocol (Best) or random activity protocol (Random) at baseline, 
after 3 weeks of overload training, and after a 2-week taper. Magnitudes of 
changes in total, lean and fat mass from baseline-overload, overload-taper and 
baseline-taper were assessed by standardization (Δmean/SD).
RESULTS: The standard deviations of change scores for total and fat-free soft 
tissue mass (FFST) from Random scans (2-3%) were approximately double those 
observed in the Best (1-2%), owing to extra random errors associated with Random 
scans at baseline. There was little difference in change scores for fat mass. 
The effect of cold water immersion therapy on baseline-taper changes in FFST was 
possibly harmful (-0.7%; 90% confidence limits ±1.2%) with Best scans but 
unclear with Random scans (0.9%; ±2.0%). Both protocols gave similar possibly 
harmful effects of cold water immersion therapy on changes in fat mass (6.9%; 
±13.5% and 5.5%; ±14.3%, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: An interesting effect of cold water immersion therapy on 
training-induced changes in body composition might have been missed with a less 
precise scanning protocol. DXA scans should be undertaken with Best.

Sprint (high-intensity) exercise performance is reduced when immediately 
preceded by cold water immersion (CWI). We aimed to investigate whether this 
performance effect could be attenuated by combining an active recovery (arm 
exercise) with hip-level CWI, and whether this attenuation may be related to an 
effect on core temperature (Tcore ). Participants (n = 8) completed three 
Wingate tests before (Ex1) and after (Ex2) four different 30-min recovery 
interventions: CWI at 15 °C (CW15), arm exercise during CWI at 15 °C (CW15+AE), 
arm exercise during thermoneutral immersion at 34 °C (TW34+AE) and non-immersed 
arm exercise (AE). After AE and TW34+AE, performance during Ex2 was not 
different from Ex1; while after CW15+AE and CW15, performance was reduced by 
4.9% and 7.6%, respectively. Arm exercise maintained Tcore during recovery in 
CW15+AE, while it declined to a larger extent upon commencement of Ex2 (-0.9 °C) 
when compared with CW15 (-0.6 °C). This suggests similar leg muscle cooling 
during recovery in CW15 and CW15+AE. Without any other significant effects 
(e.g., on blood lactate), these data suggest that the improvement in sprint 
performance following an active CWI recovery, over CWI alone, may be related to 
maintained Tcore and its effect on neurophysiological mechanisms that drive 
muscle activation, but not by reduced muscle cooling.

water immersion.

PURPOSE: We investigated the acute effects of cold water immersion (CWI) or 
passive recovery (PAS) on physiological responses during high-intensity interval 
training (HIIT).
METHODS: In a crossover design, 14 cyclists completed 2 HIIT sessions (HIIT1 and 
HIIT2) separated by 30 min. Between HIIT sessions, they stood in cold water (10 
°C) up to their umbilicus, or at room temperature (27 °C) for 5 min. The natural 
logarithm of square-root of mean squared differences of successive R-R intervals 
(ln rMSSD) was assessed pre- and post-HIIT1 and HIIT2. Stroke volume (SV), 
cardiac output (Q), O2 uptake (VO2), total muscle hemoglobin (t Hb) and 
oxygenation of the vastus lateralis were recorded (using near infrared 
spectroscopy); heart rate, Q, and VO2 on-kinetics (i.e., mean response time, 
MRT), muscle de-oxygenation rate, and anaerobic contribution to exercise were 
calculated for HIIT1 and HIIT2.
RESULTS: ln rMSSD was likely higher [between-trial difference (90% confidence 
interval) [+13.2% (3.3; 24.0)] after CWI compared with PAS. CWI also likely 
increased SV [+5.9% (-0.1; 12.1)], possibly increased Q [+4.4% (-1.0; 10.3)], 
possibly slowed Q MRT [+18.3% (-4.1; 46.0)], very likely slowed VO2 MRT [+16.5% 
(5.8; 28.4)], and likely increased the anaerobic contribution to exercise [+9.7% 
(-1.7; 22.5)].
CONCLUSION: CWI between HIIT slowed VO2 on-kinetics, leading to increased 
anaerobic contribution during HIIT2. This detrimental effect of CWI was likely 
related to peripheral adjustments, because the slowing of VO2 on-kinetics was 
twofold greater than that of central delivery of O2 (i.e., Q). CWI has 
detrimental effects on high-intensity aerobic exercise performance that persist 
for ≥ 45 min.

PURPOSE: To examine the effects of four commonly used recovery treatments 
applied between two bouts of intense endurance cycling on the performance of the 
second bout in normothermia (~21 °C).
METHODS: Nine trained men completed two submaximal exhaustive cycling bouts (Ex1 
and Ex2: 5 min at ~50 % [Formula: see text] peak, followed by 5 min at ~60 % 
[Formula: see text] peak and then ~80 % [Formula: see text] peak to failure) 
separated by 30 min of (a) cold water immersion at 15 °C (C15), (b) contrast 
water therapy alternating 2.5 min at 8 °C and 2.5 min at 40 °C (CT), (c) 
thermoneutral water immersion at 34 °C (T34) and (d) cycling at ~40 % [Formula: 
see text] peak (AR).
RESULTS: Exercise performance, cardiovascular and metabolic responses during Ex1 
were similar among all trials. However, time to failure (~80 % [Formula: see 
text] peak bout) during Ex2 was significantly (P < 0.05) longer in C15 
(18.0 ± 1.6) than in CT (14.5 ± 1.5), T34 (12.4 ± 1.4) and AR (10.6 ± 1.0); and 
it was also longer (P < 0.05) in CT than AR. Core temperature and heart rate 
were significantly (P < 0.05) lower during the initial ~15 min of Ex2 during C15 
compared with all other conditions but they reached similar levels at the end of 
Ex2.
CONCLUSIONS: A 30 min period of C15 was more beneficial in maintaining intense 
submaximal cycling performance than CT, T34 and AR; and CT was also more 
beneficial than T34 and AR. These effects were not mediated by the effect of 
water immersion per se, but by the continuous (C15) or intermittent (CT) 
temperature stimulus (cold) applied throughout the recovery.

Responses to sudden cold-water immersion in inexperienced swimmers following 
training.

BACKGROUND: When suddenly immersed in cold water, humans typically exhibit the 
cold shock response, although training can attenuate hyperventilation. This 
study extends previous findings by considering the influence of physical 
activity to maintain buoyancy and subsequent swimming performance.
METHODS: Six inexperienced swimmers (three men and three women; mean age 22.8) 
received 1 wk of cold-water head-out immersions (10 x 3 min at 15 degrees C) 
alongside mental skills training to improve their treading water technique and 
to control hyperventilation upon immersion. Six inexperienced control swimmers 
(four men and two women; mean age 21.8) received immersions in temperate water 
(27 degrees C). Ventilation, brain blood flow velocity, and blood oxygenation 
were measured during a physiological test in which participants trod water for 
150 s. In a subsequent simulated survival test, performance (swimming duration 
and distance) and perception of effort were recorded. All the tests were in 10 
degrees C water with the head out.
RESULTS: There were significant improvements in the intervention group's ability 
to suppress rapid increases in respiratory frequency; 62 +/- 24 breaths x 
min(-1) to 33 +/- 12. The drop in brain blood flow was smaller and more 
transient than that previously reported due to the hypertensive response 
associated with treading water.
DISCUSSION: Inexperienced swimmers could benefit from cold-water habituation 
combined with mental skills training in order to improve voluntary control over 
the respiratory portion of the cold shock response as part of learning to tread 
water. This may improve survival prospects in a real-life emergency scenario 
such as an overturned boat.

Recovery from repeated on-court tennis sessions: combining cold-water immersion, 
compression, and sleep recovery interventions.

Author information:

NSW, Australia.

PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of combining cold-water immersion (CWI), 
full-body compression garments (CG), and sleep-hygiene recommendations on 
physical, physiological, and perceptual recovery after 2-a-day on-court training 
and match-play sessions.
METHODS: In a crossover design, 8 highly trained tennis players completed 2 
sessions of on-court tennis-drill training and match play, followed by a 
recovery or control condition. Recovery interventions included a mixture of 15 
min CWI, 3 h of wearing full-body CG, and following sleep-hygiene 
recommendations that night, while the control condition involved postsession 
stretching and no regulation of sleeping patterns. Technical performance (stroke 
and error rates), physical performance (accelerometry, countermovement jump 
[CMJ]), physiological (heart rate, blood lactate), and perceptual (mood, 
exertion, and soreness) measures were recorded from each on-court session, along 
with sleep quantity each night.
RESULTS: While stroke and error rates did not differ in the drill session (P > 
.05, d < 0.20), large effects were evident for increased time in play and stroke 
rate in match play after the recovery interventions (P > .05, d > 0.90). 
Although accelerometry values did not differ between conditions (P > .05, d < 
0.20), CMJ tended to be improved before match play with recovery (P > .05, d = 
0.90). Furthermore, CWI and CG resulted in faster postsession reductions in 
heart rate and lactate and reduced perceived soreness (P > .05, d > 1.00). In 
addition, sleep-hygiene recommendations increased sleep quantity (P > .05, d > 
2.00) and maintained lower perceived soreness and fatigue (P < .05, d > 2.00).
CONCLUSIONS: Mixed-method recovery interventions (CWI and CG) used after tennis 
sessions increased ensuing time in play and lower-body power and reduced 
perceived soreness. Furthermore, sleep-hygiene recommendations helped reduce 
perceived soreness.

This study sought to (a) compare and contrast the effect of 2 commonly used 
cryotherapy treatments, 4 min of -110 °C whole body cryotherapy and 8 °C cold 
water immersion, on knee skin temperature and (b) establish whether either 
protocol was capable of achieving a skin temperature (<13 °C) believed to be 
required for analgesic purposes. After ethics committee approval and written 
informed consent was obtained, 10 healthy males (26.5±4.9 yr, 183.5±6.0 cm, 
90.7±19.9 kg, 26.8±5.0 kg/m2, 23.0±9.3% body fat; mean±SD) participated in this 
randomised controlled crossover study. Skin temperature around the patellar 
region was assessed in both knees via non-contact, infrared thermal imaging and 
recorded pre-, immediately post-treatment and every 10 min thereafter for 
60 min. Compared to baseline, average, minimum and maximum skin temperatures 
were significantly reduced (p<0.001) immediately post-treatment and at 10, 20, 
30, 40, 50 and 60 min after both cooling modalities. Average and minimum skin 
temperatures were lower (p<0.05) immediately after whole body cryotherapy 
(19.0±0.9 °C) compared to cold water immersion (20.5±0.6 °C). However, from 10 
to 60 min post, the average, minimum and maximum skin temperatures were lower 
(p<0.05) following the cold water treatment. Finally, neither protocol achieved 
a skin temperature believed to be required to elicit an analgesic effect.

Cold modalities with different thermodynamic properties have similar effects on

Although tissue cooling is widely used in the treatment of musculoskeletal 
injuries there is still controversy about its effects on muscular performance. 
The combination of cooling and exercise justifies the study of this topic. The 
aim was to compare the effects of ice pack and cold-water immersion on the 
muscular performance parameters of plantar flexors and muscular activation of 
the triceps surae. 41 healthy men (mean age: 22.1 years, SD: 2.9) were randomly 
assigned to cooling with either ice pack (n=20) or cold-water immersion (n=21). 
Independent variables were cold modality (ice pack or cold-water immersion) and 
pre- and post-cooling measurement time. Dependent variables were muscular 
performance (measured during isometric and concentric contractions of plantar 
flexors) and electromyography parameters of the triceps surae (median frequency 
and root mean square amplitude). Dependent-samples t-tests were used to compare 
pre- and post-cooling data and independent-samples t-tests were used to compare 
the difference (pre- and post-cooling) between groups. Ice pack increased 
isometric peak torque (mean: 9.00 Nm, P=0.01) and both cold modalities reduced 
muscular activation in triceps surae (P<0.0001); Cold-water immersion and ice 
pack reduced peak torque and total work during dynamic isokinetic contraction at 
both velocities (mean: -11,00 Nm, P<0.05) and affected muscular activation in 
different ways. In conclusion, ice pack increases isometric torque, while both 
ice pack and cold-water immersion decrease concentric muscular performance. 
These results indicate that these cooling methods should be chosen with caution, 
considering the type of task required during training or rehabilitation. New 
studies investigating other muscle groups and joints are necessary.

This study examined the effects of post-exercise cooling on recovery of 
neuromuscular, physiological, and cerebral hemodynamic responses after 
intermittent-sprint exercise in the heat. Nine participants underwent three 
post-exercise recovery trials, including a control (CONT), mixed-method cooling 
(MIX), and cold-water immersion (10 °C; CWI). Voluntary force and activation 
were assessed simultaneously with cerebral oxygenation (near-infrared 
spectroscopy) pre- and post-exercise, post-intervention, and 1-h and 24-h 
post-exercise. Measures of heart rate, core temperature, skin temperature, 
muscle damage, and inflammation were also collected. Both cooling interventions 
reduced heart rate, core, and skin temperature post-intervention (P < 0.05). CWI 
hastened the recovery of voluntary force by 12.7 ± 11.7% (mean ± SD) and 
16.3 ± 10.5% 1-h post-exercise compared to MIX and CONT, respectively 
(P < 0.01). Voluntary force remained elevated by 16.1 ± 20.5% 24-h post-exercise 
after CWI compared to CONT (P < 0.05). Central activation was increased 
post-intervention and 1-h post-exercise with CWI compared to CONT (P < 0.05), 
without differences between conditions 24-h post-exercise (P > 0.05). CWI 
reduced cerebral oxygenation compared to MIX and CONT post-intervention 
(P < 0.01). Furthermore, cooling interventions reduced cortisol 1-h 
post-exercise (P < 0.01), although only CWI blunted creatine kinase 24-h 
post-exercise compared to CONT (P < 0.05). Accordingly, improvements in 
neuromuscular recovery after post-exercise cooling appear to be disassociated 
with cerebral oxygenation, rather reflecting reductions in thermoregulatory 
demands to sustain force production.

Australia, Crawley, Australia. 10010789@student.uwa.edu.au

PURPOSE: This study investigated the effect of cold water immersion after 
evening exercise on subsequent sleep quality and quantity in trained cyclists.
METHODS: In the evenings (~1900 h) on three separate occasions, male cyclists (n 
= 11) underwent either no exercise (control, CON), exercise only (EX), or 
exercise followed by cold water immersion (CWI). EX comprised cycling for 15 min 
at 75% peak power, then a 15-min maximal time trial. After each condition, a 
full laboratory-based sleep study (polysomnography) was performed. Core and skin 
temperature, heart rate, salivary melatonin, ratings of perceived fatigue, and 
recovery were measured in each trial.
RESULTS: No differences were observed between conditions for any whole night 
sleep measures, including total sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep onset 
latency, rapid eye movement onset latency, wake after sleep onset, or proportion 
of the night spent in different sleep stages. Core temperature in EX and CWI 
trials was higher than CON, until it decreased below that of EX and CON until 
bedtime in CWI. After bedtime, core temperature was similar for all conditions 
throughout the night, except for a 90-min period where it was lower for CWI than 
EX and CON (3.5-4.5 h postexercise). Heart rates for EX and CWI were both 
significantly higher than CON postexercise until bedtime, whereas skin 
temperature after CWI was significantly lower than EX and CON, remaining lower 
than EX until 3 h postexercise. Melatonin levels and recovery ratings were 
similar between conditions. Fatigue ratings were significantly elevated after 
exercise in both CWI and EX conditions, with EX still being elevated compared 
with CON at bedtime.
CONCLUSION: Whole night sleep architecture is not affected by evening exercise 
alone or when followed by CWI.

Individual perception of recovery is related to subsequent sprint performance.

BACKGROUND: Training recovery is vital for adaptation and performance, and to 
avoid cumulative fatigue and symptoms associated with overtraining. The use of 
cold-water immersion (CWI) as a recovery strategy is common; however, the 
physiological and biochemical rationale behind its use remains unclear. This 
study aimed to assess the relationship between body temperature responses to 
water immersion and individual perception of recovery, with subsequent exercise 
performance.
METHODS: Twelve male rugby players participated in a 3-week cross-over trial 
where an intense 60 min conditioning session was followed immediately by 15 min 
of either 14°C CWI, 30°C warm-water immersion (WWI) or passive control (CON) 
recovery intervention. Postexercise body temperatures and subjective ratings of 
the recovery intervention were recorded and subsequently related to performance 
in a 5×40 m repeated sprint protocol undertaken 24 h later.
RESULTS: CWI induced large reductions in core body temperature postimmersion 
(effect size (ES) range 1.05-3.21) and improved subsequent sprint performance 
compared to WWI (ES 1.04±0.84) and CON (ES 1.44±0.84). Both the degree of 
temperature decrease at 60 min postimmersion (r=0.6948; p=0.0121) and the 
subjective rating of the recovery intervention (r=0.5886; p=0.0441) were related 
to subsequent sprint performance. A very strong linear correlation was observed 
when these two factors were integrated (r=0.7743; p=0.0031).
CONCLUSION: A combination of physiological and psychological indices provides an 
improved indication of subsequent performance and suggests an important role of 
individual perception in enhancing training recovery.

Postexercise cold-water immersion does not attenuate muscle glycogen 
resynthesis.

CH, Morton JP.

University, Liverpool, United Kingdom. W.Gregson@ljmu.ac.uk

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that postexercise 
cold-water immersion (CWI, via its associated reductions in skeletal muscle 
blood flow) attenuates muscle glycogen resynthesis during short-term recovery 
from exhaustive exercise.
METHODS: In a repeated-measures design, nine recreationally active men performed 
an exhaustive glycogen depleting cycling protocol (consisting of intermittent 
exercise the night before and steady-state exercise on the subsequent morning of 
the main trial) followed by 10 min of lower-limb CWI (8°C) or remained seated in 
normal ambient conditions (CONT). Subjects were fed carbohydrate (CHO) at an 
ingestion rate of 0.6 g·kg body mass at 30 min postexercise and at 1, 2, and 3 h 
postexercise.
RESULTS: Reductions in thigh skin temperature and muscle temperature during 
postexercise recovery were greater in CWI compared with CONT (P < 0.01). In 
addition, norepinephrine and blood glucose concentrations were increased and 
decreased, respectively, during recovery in CWI compared with CONT (P < 0.01). 
Postexercise muscle glycogen (CONT and CWI postexercise = 76 ± 43 and 77 ± 26 
mmol·kg dry weight [dw], respectively; mean ± SD) progressively increased (P < 
0.01) during recovery, although rates of resynthesis did not differ (P = 0.719) 
between conditions (CONT and CWI 4 h postexercise = 160 ± 34 and 157 ± 59 
mmol·kg dw, respectively). Total glycogen synthesis during recovery was 
comparable (CONT and CWI = 83 ± 43 and 79 ± 58 mmol·kg dw, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Postexercise CWI does not attenuate muscle glycogen resynthesis 
rates during short-term recovery even when CHO availability is considered 
suboptimal. Athletes who regularly incorporate CWI as a recovery strategy to 
alleviate symptoms of exercise-induced muscle damage should therefore not be 
concerned with potential negative effects of the associated reductions in muscle 
blood flow on the restoration of muscle glycogen stores.

Effect of post-exercise hydrotherapy water temperature on subsequent exhaustive 
running performance in normothermic conditions.

Author information:
(1)Department of Physiology, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin 2, Ireland.

OBJECTIVE: Despite the widespread use of cold water immersion (CWI) in 
normothermic conditions, little data is available on its effect on subsequent 
endurance performance. This study examined the effect of CWI as a recovery 
strategy on subsequent running performance in normothermic ambient conditions 
(∼22°C).
DESIGN: Nine endurance-trained men completed two submaximal exhaustive running 
bouts on three separate occasions. The running bouts (Ex1 and Ex2) were 
separated by 15min of un-immersed seated rest (CON), hip-level CWI at 8°C 
(CWI-8) or hip-level CWI at 15°C (CWI-15).
METHODS: Intestinal temperature, blood lactate and heart rate were recorded 
throughout and V˙O2, running economy and exercise times were recorded during the 
running sessions.
RESULTS: Running time to failure (min) during Ex2 was significantly (p<0.05, 
ES=0.7) longer following CWI-8 (27.7±6.3) than CON (23.3±5) but not different 
between CWI-15 (26.3±3.4) and CON (p=0.06, ES=0.7) or CWI-8 and CWI-15 (p=0.4, 
ES=0.2). Qualitative analyses showed a 95% and 89% likely beneficial effect of 
CWI-8 and CWI-15 during Ex2 compared with CON, respectively. Time to failure 
during Ex2 was significantly shorter than Ex1 only during the CON condition. 
Intestinal temperature and HR were significantly lower for most of Ex2 during 
CWI-8 and CWI-15 compared with CON but they were similar at failure for the 
three conditions. Blood lactate, running economy and V˙O2 were not altered by 
CWI.
CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that a 15min period of cold water immersion 
applied between repeated exhaustive exercise bouts significantly reduces 
intestinal temperature and enhances post-immersion running performance in 
normothermic conditions.

The aim of this investigation was to elucidate the reductions in muscle, skin 
and core temperature following exposure to -110°C whole body cryotherapy (WBC), 
and compare these to 8°C cold water immersion (CWI). Twenty active male subjects 
were randomly assigned to a 4-min exposure of WBC or CWI. A minimum of 7 days 
later subjects were exposed to the other treatment. Muscle temperature in the 
right vastus lateralis (n=10); thigh skin (average, maximum and minimum) and 
rectal temperature (n=10) were recorded before and 60 min after treatment. The 
greatest reduction (P<0.05) in muscle (mean ± SD; 1 cm: WBC, 1.6 ± 1.2°C; CWI, 
2.0 ± 1.0°C; 2 cm: WBC, 1.2 ± 0.7°C; CWI, 1.7 ± 0.9°C; 3 cm: WBC, 1.6 ± 0.6°C; 
CWI, 1.7 ± 0.5°C) and rectal temperature (WBC, 0.3 ± 0.2°C; CWI, 0.4 ± 0.2°C) 
were observed 60 min after treatment. The largest reductions in average (WBC, 
12.1 ± 1.0°C; CWI, 8.4 ± 0.7°C), minimum (WBC, 13.2 ± 1.4°C; CWI, 8.7 ± 0.7°C) 
and maximum (WBC, 8.8 ± 2.0°C; CWI, 7.2 ± 1.9°C) skin temperature occurred 
immediately after both CWI and WBC (P<0.05). Skin temperature was significantly 
lower (P<0.05) immediately after WBC compared to CWI. The present study 
demonstrates that a single WBC exposure decreases muscle and core temperature to 
a similar level of those experienced after CWI. Although both treatments 
significantly reduced skin temperature, WBC elicited a greater decrease compared 
to CWI. These data may provide information to clinicians and researchers 
attempting to optimise WBC and CWI protocols in a clinical or sporting setting.

The aim of this study was to compare the effects of intermittent cold-water 
immersion and massage on perceptual and performance markers of recovery by 
basketball players after competitive matches. Eight men (age 23 ± 3 years; 
stature 190.5 ± 8.9 cm; body mass 90.3 ± 9.6 kg; body fat 12.8 ± 4.8%) and eight 
women (age 22 ± 2 years; stature 179.0 ± 8.5 cm; body mass 77.6 ± 9.2 kg; body 
fat 22.5 ± 6.6%) basketball players participated. Massage, cold-water immersion 
or control were applied immediately after competitive matches, followed by 
assessments of perceptual measures of recovery and physical performance, 
countermovement jump and repeated-sprint ability 24 h after intervention. There 
was lower perception of fatigue overall and in the legs immediately after the 
massage and cold-water immersion condition (P < 0.001; η²(P) = 0.91). 
Furthermore, women had a lower perception of fatigue in cold-water immersion 
than massage at any testing time (P < 0.001; η²(P) = 0.37). Jump performance was 
greater after cold-water immersion than the control condition (P = 0.037, η²(P) 
= 0.37). There was no effect of any of the recovery interventions on 
repeated-sprint measures (P at best 0.067, η²(P) at best 0.68). The results 
suggest that both massage and cold-water immersion improve perceptual measures 
of recovery. Furthermore, cold-water immersion improves jump performance 
although neither such immersion nor massage had an effect on repeated-sprint 
ability. This suggests that, overall, cold-water immersion is more useful than 
massage in the recovery from basketball matches, especially in women.

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of cool water immersion (20 °C; 
CWI) while wearing a cooling jacket (Cryovest;V) and a passive control (PAS) as 
recovery methods on physiological and thermoregulatory responses between 2 
exercise bouts in temperate conditions. Nine well-trained male cyclists 
performed 2 successive bouts of 45 min of endurance cycling exercise in a 
temperate environment (20 °C) separated by 25 min of the respective recovery 
interventions. Capillary blood samples were obtained to measure lactate (La⁻), 
sodium (Na⁺), bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) concentrations and pH, whilst body mass loss 
(BML), core temperature (T(core)), skin temperature (T(skin)), heart rate (HR), 
oxygen uptake , and minute ventilation were measured before (Pre), immediately 
after the first exercise bout (Ex1), the recovery (R), and after the second 
exercise bout (Ex2). V and CWI both resulted in a reduction of T(skin) at R 
(-2.1 ± 0.01 °C and -11.6 ± 0.01 °C, respectively, p < 0.01). Despite no 
difference in final values post-Ex2 (p > 0.05), V attenuated the rise in HR, 
minute ventilation, and oxygen uptake from Ex1 to Ex2, while T(core) and T(skin) 
were significantly lower following the second session (p < 0.05). Further, CWI 
was also beneficial in lowering T(core), T(skin), and BML, while a rise in Na⁺ 
was observed following Ex2 (p < 0.05). Overall results indicate that cooling 
interventions (V and CWI) following exercise in a temperate environment provide 
a reduction in thermal strain during ensuing exercise bouts.

In team sports, a cycle of training, competition, and recovery occurs weekly 
during the competitive season. In this research, we evaluated hydrotherapy for 
recovery from a simulated game of rugby union tracked over a week of training. 
Twenty-four experienced male rugby union players (mean ± SD age 19.46 ± 0.82 
years, weight 82.38 ± 11.12 kg, height 178.54 ± 5.75 cm) were randomly divided 
into 3 groups: cold water immersion (n = 8), contrast bath therapy (n = 8), and 
a control group (n = 8). The 2 forms of hydrotherapy were administered 
immediately after a simulated rugby game. Testing was conducted 1 hour before 
the game and at 5 intervals postgame: 1, 48, 72, 96, and 144 hours. Dependent 
variables included countermovement jump, 10- and 40-m sprints, sessional rating 
of perceived exertion (RPE), flexibility, thigh circumference, and self-reported 
delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Significant differences in DOMS were found 
between the cold water immersion and contrast bath groups at 48 hours post 
intervention (p = 0.02), and between the control and contrast bath groups at 72 
(p = 0.03) and 96 (p = 0.04) hours post intervention. Cold water immersion and 
contrast bath groups reported significantly different RPE at 72 hours (p = ?) 
and 96 hours post (p = 0.05) intervention. Athletes' perceptions of muscle 
soreness and sessional RPE scores for training were greater in the contrast bath 
group (20%) after the simulated game and throughout the training week. Although 
results from passive and power tests were inconclusive in determining whether 
cold water immersion or passive recovery was more effective in attenuating 
fatigue, results indicated contrast baths had little benefit in enhancing 
recovery during a cyclic week of rugby union.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the associations between post-game recovery protocols 
and physical and perceptual recovery, and game performance in Australian 
Football League players.
DESIGN: A longitudinal quasi-experimental study design was used across a season.
METHODS: A full squad of 44 footballers was monitored weekly across a 23-game 
season. Players were required to choose from a number of recovery modalities 
available immediately post-game. These included floor stretching, pool 
stretching, bike active recovery, pool active recovery, cold-water immersion, 
contrast therapy and use of a compression garment. Perceptual measures of 
recovery were recorded throughout the week and a test of physical performance 
was conducted two days post-game. Game performance ratings were also recorded. 
The associations between the post-game recovery protocols chosen and players' 
perceived recovery, and physical and game performances were determined by the 
association rule data-mining strategy.
RESULTS: Statistically significant associations were found between a number of 
post-game recovery protocols and perceptual recovery. In general, players who 
chose cold-water immersion, floor stretching, no active recovery (neither bike 
or pool) and the use of a compression garment post-game, had an increased 
probability of reporting greater perceptual recovery across the following week, 
relative to all other permutations of recovery protocols chosen. There were no 
associations found between post-game recovery protocol combinations and physical 
recovery. No associations were found between the post-game recovery methods and 
the next game performance.
CONCLUSIONS: Perceptual recovery among players was enhanced through the 
selection of specific combinations of recovery protocols post game. However, no 
links were found between recovery protocols and physical or game performance 
measures.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential benefits of cold 
water immersion (CWI) and active recovery (AR) on blood lactate concentration 
([Lac]) and heart rate variability (HRV) indices following high-intensity 
exercise. 20 male subjects were recruited. On the first visit, an incremental 
test was performed to determine maximal oxygen consumption and the associated 
speed (MAS). The remaining 3 visits for the performance of constant velocity 
exhaustive tests at MAS and different recovery methods (6 min) were separated by 
7-day intervals [randomized: CWI, AR or passive recovery (PR)]. The CWI and AR 
lowered [Lac] (p<0.05) at 11, 13 and 15 min after exercise cessation in 
comparison to PR. There was a 'time' and 'recovery mode' interaction for 2 HRV 
indices: standard deviation of normal R-R intervals (SDNN) (partial eta 
squared=0.114) and natural log of low-frequency power density (lnLF) (partial 
eta squared=0.090). CWI presented significantly higher SDNN compared to PR at 15 
min of recovery (p<0.05). In addition, greater SDNN values were found in CWI vs. 
AR during the application of recovery interventions, and at 30 and 75 min 
post-exercise (p<0.05 for all differences). The lnLF during the recovery 
interventions and at 75 min post-exercise was greater using CWI compared with AR 
(p<0.05). For square root of the mean of the sum of the squares of differences 
between adjacent R-R intervals (RMSSD) and natural log of high-frequency power 
density (lnHF), a moderate effect size was found between CWI and PR during the 
recovery interventions and at 15 min post-exercise. Our findings show that AR 
and CWI offer benefits regarding the removal of [Lac] following high-intensity 
exercise. While limited, CWI results in some improvement in post-exercise 
cardiac autonomic regulation compared to AR and PR. Further, AR is not 
recommended if the aim is to accelerate the parasympathetic reactivation.

Australia.

PURPOSE: The authors investigated the efficacy of a single exposure to 14 min of 
cold-water immersion (COLD) and contrast water therapy (CWT) on posttraining 
recovery in Australian football (AF).
METHOD: Fourteen AF players participated in 3 wk of standardized training. After 
week 1 training, all players completed a passive recovery (PAS). During week 2, 
COLD or CWT was randomly assigned. Players undertook the opposing intervention 
in week 3. Repeat-sprint ability (6 × 20 m), countermovement and squat jumps, 
perceived muscle soreness, and fatigue were measured pretraining and over 48 h 
posttraining.
RESULTS: Immediately posttraining, groups exhibited similar performance and 
psychometric declines. At 24 h, repeat-sprint time had deteriorated by 4.1% for 
PAS and 1.0% for CWT but was fully restored by COLD (0.0%). At 24 and 48 h, both 
COLD and CWT attenuated changes in mean muscle soreness, with COLD (0.6 ± 0.6 
and 0.0 ± 0.4) more effective than CWT (1.9 ± 0.7 and 1.0 ± 0.7) and PAS having 
minimal effect (5.5 ± 0.6 and 4.0 ± 0.5). Similarly, after 24 and 48 h, COLD and 
CWT both effectively reduced changes in perceived fatigue, with COLD (0.6 ± 0.6 
and 0.0 ± 0.6) being more successful than CWT (0.8 ± 0.6 and 0.7 ± 0.6) and PAS 
having the smallest effect (2.2 ± 0.8 and 2.4 ± 0.6).
CONCLUSIONS: AF training can result in prolonged physical and psychometric 
deficits persisting for up to 48 h. For restoring physical-performance and 
psychometric measures, COLD was more effective than CWT, with PAS being the 
least effective. Based on these results the authors recommend that 14 min of 
COLD be used after AF training.

To evaluate the effects of cooling between exercise sessions on intramuscular 
water movement and muscle performance, the lower extremities of nine untrained 
men were assigned to either a cooling protocol (20-min water immersion, 15 °C) 
or a noncooling protocol. Each subject performed two exercise sessions involving 
maximal concentric knee extension and flexion (three repetitions, 60°/s; 
followed by 50 repetitions, 180°/s). The peak torque at 60°/s and total work, 
mean power, and decrease rate of torque value at 180°/s were evaluated. Axial 
magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted images of the mid-thigh were obtained 
before and after each exercise session. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) 
values for the quadriceps and hamstrings were calculated for evaluating 
intramuscular water movement. Both groups exhibited significantly increased ADC 
values for the quadriceps and hamstrings after each exercise session. These ADC 
values returned to the pre-exercise level after water immersion. No significant 
difference was observed in muscle performance from first exercise session to the 
next in either group, except for increased total work and mean power in knee 
flexion in the cooled group. Cooling intervention between exercise sessions 
decreased exercise-induced elevation of intramuscular water movement and had 
some beneficial effects on muscle endurance of knee flexors, but not knee 
extensors.

INTRODUCTION: Bed rest is a terrestrial experimental analogue of unloading 
experienced during exposure to microgravity. Such unloading causes atrophy 
predominantly of the postural muscles, especially those of the lower limbs.
METHODS: We tested the hypothesis that 35 d horizontal bed rest alters 
thermoregulatory responses of subjects (N = 10) immersed in 15 degrees C water, 
particularly the heat produced by the shivering tremor of the skeletal muscles. 
Before and after bed rest we measured the thickness of the gastrocnemius 
medialis (GM), vastus lateralis (VL), tibialis anterior (TA), and biceps brachii 
(BB) muscles by ultrasonography. During the immersions, we monitored rectal and 
skin temperatures, heat flux, heart rate, and oxygen uptake.
RESULTS: After bed rest, muscle thickness decreased significantly by 12.2 +/- 
8.8% and 8.0 +/- 9.1% in the GM and VL, respectively. No changes were observed 
in the TA and BB muscles. The 35-d bed rest caused a significant reduction in 
aerobic power, as reflected in maximal oxygen uptake. There were no significant 
differences in any of the observed thermoregulatory responses between the pre- 
and post-bed rest immersions.
CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular and muscular deconditioning had no effect on the 
heat production and heat loss responses. Due to the significant reduction in the 
mass of the muscles in the lower limbs, concomitant with no change in heat 
production, we conclude that leg muscles do not play a significant role in 
shivering thermogenesis.

The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of pre-exercise ice slurry 
ingestion and cold water immersion on submaximal running time in the heat. On 
three separate occasions, eight males ran to exhaustion at their first 
ventilatory threshold in the heat (34.0 ± 0.1 ° C, 52 ± 3% relative humidity) 
following one of three 30 min pre-exercise manoeuvres: (1) ice slurry ingestion; 
(2) cold water immersion; or (3) warm fluid ingestion (control). Running time 
was longer following cold water immersion (56.8 ± 5.6 min; P = 0.008) and ice 
slurry ingestion (52.7 ± 8.4 min; P = 0.005) compared with control (46.7 ± 7.2 
min), but not significantly different between cold water immersion and ice 
slurry ingestion (P = 0.335). During exercise, rectal temperature was lower with 
cold water immersion from 15 and 20 min into exercise compared with control and 
ice slurry ingestion, respectively, and remained lower until 40 min (P = 0.001). 
At exhaustion rectal temperature was significantly higher following ice slurry 
ingestion (39.76 ± 0.36 ° C) compared with control (39.48 ± 0.36 ° C; P = 0.042) 
and tended to be higher than cold water immersion (39.48 ± 0.34 ° C; P = 0.065). 
As run times were similar between conditions, ice slurry ingestion may be a 
comparable form of pre-cooling to cold water immersion.

This randomized, controlled, laboratory study was designed to examine the effect 
of cold water immersion (CWI) as a recovery modality on repeat performance on 
the yo-yo intermittent recovery test (YIRT), a widely accepted tool for the 
evaluation of physical performance in soccer, separated by 48 hours. Twenty-two 
healthy Division I collegiate soccer players (13 men and 9 women; age, 19.8 ± 
1.1 years; height, 174.0 ± 9.0 cm; mass, 72.1 ± 9.1 kg) volunteered as 
participants during the noncompetitive season. The YIRT was used to induce 
volitional fatigue and was administered at baseline and again 48 hours later. 
Athletes progressively increased sprint speed between markers set 20 m apart 
until pace was failed. Countermovement vertical jump (CMVJ) was used to assess 
anaerobic power and was measured before YIRT, immediately post-YIRT, and 24 and 
48 hours post-YIRT. A 10-cm horizontal visual analog scale was administered 
immediately, 24 hours and 48 hours post-YIRT to assess perceived fatigue (PF) in 
the legs. Participants were randomly placed into the CWI or control group. The 
CWI condition consisted of immersion to the umbilicus in a 12°C pool for 15 
minutes, whereas the control group sat quietly for 15 minutes. There were no 
significant differences between intervention conditions on YIRT performance 
(control, 4,900 ± 884 m; CWI, 5,288 ± 1,000 m; p = 0.35) or PF (control, 9.4 ± 
0.5 cm; CWI, 9.3 ± 0.6 cm; p = 0.65) at 48 hours post-YIRT. There was a main 
time effect for CMVJ over 48 hours, but no group differences (pre-YIRT, 64.6 ± 
11.0 cm; post-YIRT, 66.4 ± 10.9 cm; 24 hours post-YIRT, 63.4 ± 9.9 cm; 48 hours 
post-YIRT, 63.1 ± 9.4 cm; p = 0.02). This study demonstrated that in collegiate 
soccer players, CWI performed immediately and 24 hours after induced volitional 
fatigue did not affect subsequent physical performance estimates.

and Rehabilitation, Faculty of Sport Sciences, Amiens, France.

PURPOSE: We investigated the effect of daily cold water immersion (CWI), during 
a typical training week, on parasympathetic activity and subjective ratings of 
well-being.
METHODS: Over two different weeks, eight highly trained swimmers (4 men; 19.6 ± 
3.2 y) performed their usual training load (5 d/wk, approx. 21 h/wk). Last 
training session of each training day was immediately followed by 5 min of 
seated recovery, in randomized order, with CWI (15°C) or without (CON). Each 
morning before the first training session (6:30 AM) during the two experimental 
weeks, subjective ratings of well-being (eg, quality of sleep) were assessed and 
the R-R intervals were recorded for 5 min in supine position. A vagal-related 
index (ie, natural logarithm of the square root of the mean of the sum of the 
squares of differences between adjacent normal R-R intervals; Ln rMSSD) was 
calculated from the last 3-min segment.
RESULTS: Compared with CON, CWI effect on Ln rMSSD was rated as possibly 
beneficial on day 2 [7.0% (-3; 19)], likely beneficial on day 3 [20.0% (1.5; 
43.5)], very likely beneficial on day 4 [30.4% (12.2; 51.6)] and likely 
beneficial on day 5 [24.1% (-0.4; 54.8)]. Cold water immersion was associated 
with a likely greater quality of sleep on day 2 [30.0% (2.7; 64.6)], very likely 
on day 3 [31.0% (5.0; 63.1)] and likely on day 4 [38.6% (11.4; 72.4)] when 
compared with CON.
CONCLUSION: Five minutes of CWI following training can reduce the usual 
exercise-induced decrease in parasympathetic activity and is associated with 
improved rating of perceived sleep quality.

BACKGROUND: Different cryotherapy modalities have distinct effects on sensory 
and motor nerve conduction parameters. However, it is unclear how these 
parameters change during the post-cooling period and how the exercise carried 
out in this period would influence the recovery of nerve conduction velocity 
(NCV).
OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of three cryotherapy modalities on 
post-cooling NCV and to analyze the effect of walking on the recovery of sensory 
and motor NCV.
METHODS: Thirty six healthy young subjects were randomly allocated into three 
groups: ice massage (n=12), ice pack (n=12) and cold water immersion (n=12). The 
modalities were applied to the right leg. The subjects of each modality group 
were again randomized to perform a post-cooling activity: a) 30 min rest, b) 
walking 15 min followed by 15 min rest. The NCV of sural (sensory) and posterior 
tibial (motor) nerves was evaluated. Initial (pre-cooling) and final (30 min 
post-cooling) NCV were compared using a paired t-test. The effects of the 
modalities and the post-cooling activities on NCV were evaluated by an analysis 
of covariance. The significance level was α=0.05.
RESULTS: There was a significant difference between immersion and ice massage on 
final sensory NCV (p=0.009). Ice pack and ice massage showed similar effects 
(p>0.05). Walking accelerated the recovery of sensory and motor NCV, regardless 
of the modality previously applied (p<0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Cold water immersion was the most effective modality for 
maintaining reduced sensory nerve conduction after cooling. Walking after 
cooling, with any of the three modalities, enhances the recovery of sensory and 
motor NCV.

Hyperthermia is common among athletes and in a variety of environments. The 
purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of cooling methods on 
core body temperature, heart rate (HR), and perceptual readings in individuals 
after exercise. Sixteen subjects (age: 24 ± 6 years, height: 182 ± 7 cm, weight: 
74.03 ± 9.17 kg, and body fat: 17.08 ± 6.23%) completed 10 exercise sessions in 
warm conditions (WBGT: 26.64 ± 4.71°C) followed by body cooling by 10 different 
methods. Cooling methods included cold water immersion (CWI), shade, 
Port-a-Cool® (FAN), Emergency Cold Containment System® (ECCS), Rehab. Hood® 
(HOOD), Game Ready Active Cooling Vest™ (GRV), Nike Ice Vest™ (NIV), ice buckets 
(IBs), and ice towels (IT). These cooling modes were compared with a control 
(SUN). Rectal temperature (T(re)), HR, thermal sensation, thirst sensation, and 
a 56-question Environmental Symptoms Questionnaire (ESQ) were used to assess 
physiological and perceptual data. Average T(re) after exercise across all 
trials was 38.73 ± 0.12°C. After 10 minutes of cooling, CWI (-0.65 ± 0.29°C), 
ECCS (-0.68 ± 0.24°C), and IB (-0.74 ± 0.34°C) had significantly (p < 0.006) 
greater decreases in T(re) compared with that in SUN (-0.42 ± 0.15°C). The HR 
after 10 minutes of cooling was significantly (p < 0.006) lower for CWI (82 ± 15 
b·min(-1)), ECCS (87 ± 14 b·min(-1)), and IT (84 ± 15 b·min(-1)) when compared 
with SUN (101 ± 15 b·min(-1)). The thermal sensation between modalities was all 
significantly (p < 0.006) lower (CWI: 1.5 ± 0.5; Fan: 3.0 ± 1.0; ECCS: 4.5 ± 
1.0; Hood: 4.5 ± 0.5; GRV: 4.0 ± 0.5; NIV: 4.5 ± 1.0; IB: 4.0 ± 1.0; IT: 3.0 ± 
1.0) when compared with SUN (5.5 ± 0.5), except for Shade (5.0 ± 1.0). There 
were no significant differences (p > 0.006) in thirst sensation between 
modalities. The ESQ scores were significantly (p < 0.006) lower for CWI (1 ± 6), 
Fan (4 ± 5), and IT (3 ± 8) compared with that for SUN (13 ± 12). In conclusion, 
when athletes experience mild hyperthermia, CWI, ECCS, and IB resulted in a 
significantly greater decrease in T(re). These cooling strategies are 
recommended to decrease T(re) during a brief recovery period between exercise 
bouts.

South Wales, Australia. mpointon@csu.edu.au

PURPOSE: This investigation examined the effects of cold water immersion (CWI) 
recovery after simulated collision sport exercise.
METHODS: Ten male rugby athletes performed three sessions consisting of a 2 × 
30-min intermittent-sprint exercise (ISE) protocol with either tackling (T) or 
no tackling (CONT), followed by a 20-min CWI intervention (TCWI) or passive 
recovery (TPASS and CONT) in a randomized order. The ISE consisted of a 15-m 
sprint every minute separated by self-paced bouts of hard running, jogging, and 
walking for the remainder of the minute. Every sixth rotation, participants 
performed 5 × 10-m runs, receiving a shoulder-led tackle to the lower body on 
each effort. Sprint time and distance covered during ISE were recorded, with 
voluntary (maximal voluntary contraction; MVC) and evoked neuromuscular function 
(voluntary activation; VA), electromyogram (root mean square (RMS)), ratings of 
perceived muscle soreness (MS), capillary and venous blood markers for 
metabolites and muscle damage, respectively measured before and after exercise, 
immediately after recovery, and 2 and 24 h after recovery.
RESULTS: Total distance covered during exercise was significantly greater in 
CONT (P = 0.01), without differences between TPASS and TCWI (P > 0.05). TCWI 
resulted in increased MVC, VA, and RMS immediately after recovery (P < 0.05). 
M-wave amplitude and peak twitch were significantly increased after recovery and 
2 h after recovery, respectively, in TCWI (P < 0.05). Although TCWI had no 
effect on the elevation in blood markers for muscle damage (P > 0.05), lactate 
was significantly reduced after recovery compared with TPASS (P = 0.04). CWI 
also resulted in reduced MS 2 h after recovery compared with TPASS (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of body contact reduces exercise performance, 
whereas the use of CWI results in a faster recovery of MVC, VA, and RMS and 
improves muscle contractile properties and perceptions of soreness after 
collision-based exercise.

of Sport, Brisbane, Australia. j.stanley@uq.edu.au

We investigated the effect of hydrotherapy on time-trial performance and cardiac 
parasympathetic reactivation during recovery from intense training. On three 
occasions, 18 well-trained cyclists completed 60 min high-intensity cycling, 
followed 20 min later by one of three 10-min recovery interventions: passive 
rest (PAS), cold water immersion (CWI), or contrast water immersion (CWT). The 
cyclists then rested quietly for 160 min with R-R intervals and perceptions of 
recovery recorded every 30 min. Cardiac parasympathetic activity was evaluated 
using the natural logarithm of the square root of mean squared differences of 
successive R-R intervals (ln rMSSD). Finally, the cyclists completed a 
work-based cycling time trial. Effects were examined using magnitude-based 
inferences. Differences in time-trial performance between the three trials were 
trivial. Compared with PAS, general fatigue was very likely lower for CWI 
(difference [90% confidence limits; -12% (-18; -5)]) and CWT [-11% (-19; -2)]. 
Leg soreness was almost certainly lower following CWI [-22% (-30; -14)] and CWT 
[-27% (-37; -15)]. The change in mean ln rMSSD following the recovery 
interventions (ln rMSSD(Post-interv)) was almost certainly higher following CWI 
[16.0% (10.4; 23.2)] and very likely higher following CWT [12.5% (5.5; 20.0)] 
compared with PAS, and possibly higher following CWI [3.7% (-0.9; 8.4)] compared 
with CWT. The correlations between performance, ln rMSSD(Post-interv) and 
perceptions of recovery were unclear. A moderate correlation was observed 
between ln rMSSD(Post-interv) and leg soreness [r = -0.50 (-0.66; -0.29)]. 
Although the effects of CWI and CWT on performance were trivial, the beneficial 
effects on perceptions of recovery support the use of these recovery strategies.

hypoxia.

We tested the effect of hypoxia on cutaneous vascular regulation and defense of 
core temperature during cold exposure. Twelve subjects had two microdialysis 
fibres placed in the ventral forearm and were immersed to the sternum in a 
bathtub on parallel study days (normoxia and poikilocapnic hypoxia with an 
arterial O(2) saturation of 80%). One fibre served as the control (1 mM 
propranolol) and the other received 5 mM yohimbine (plus 1 mM propranolol) to 
block adrenergic receptors. Skin blood flow was assessed at each site (laser 
Doppler flowmetry), divided by mean arterial pressure to calculate cutaneous 
vascular conductance (CVC), and scaled to baseline. Cold exposure was first 
induced by a progressive reduction in water temperature from 36 to 23°C over 30 
min to assess cutaneous vascular regulation, then by clamping the water 
temperature at 10°C for 45 min to test defense of core temperature. During 
normoxia, cold stress reduced CVC in control (-44 ± 4%) and yohimbine sites (-13 
± 7%; both P < 0.05 versus precooling). Hypoxia caused vasodilatation prior to 
cooling but resulted in greater reductions in CVC in control (-67 ± 7%) and 
yohimbine sites (-35 ± 11%) during cooling (both P < 0.05 versus precooling; 
both P < 0.05 versus normoxia). Core cooling rate during the second phase of 
cold exposure was unaffected by hypoxia (-1.81 ± 0.23°C h(-1) in normoxia versus 
-1.97 ± 0.33°C h(-1) in hypoxia; P > 0.05). We conclude that hypoxia increases 
cutaneous (non-noradrenergic) vasoconstriction during prolonged cold exposure, 
while core cooling rate is not consistently affected.

There are several types of cold adaptation based on the alteration of 
thermoregulatory response. It has been thought that the temperature of repeated 
cold exposures during the adaptation period is one of the factors affecting the 
type of cold adaptation developed. This study tested the hypothesis that 
repeated mild cold immersions would induce an insulative cold adaptation but 
would not alter the metabolic response. Seven healthy male participants were 
immersed to their xiphoid process level repeatedly in 26°C water for 60 min, 3 
days every week, for 4 weeks. During the first and last exposure of this cold 
acclimation period, the participants underwent body immersion tests measuring 
their thermoregulatory responses to cold. Separately, they conducted finger 
immersion into 5°C water for 30 min to assess their cold-induced vasodilation 
(CIVD) response before and after cold acclimation. During the immersion to 
xiphoid process, participants showed significantly lower mean skin temperature 
and skin blood flow in the forearm post-acclimation, while no adaptation was 
observed in the metabolic response. Additionally, blunted CIVD responses were 
observed after cold acclimation. From these results, it was considered that the 
participants showed an insulative-type of cold acclimation after the repeated 
mild cold immersions. The major finding of this study was the acceptance of the 
hypothesis that repeated mild cold immersion was sufficient to induce insulative 
cold adaptation but did not alter the metabolic response. It is suggested that 
the adaptation in the thermoregulatory response is specific to the response 
which is repeatedly stimulated during the adaptation process.

PURPOSE: Given the widespread use of water immersion during recovery from 
exercise, we aimed to investigate the effect of contrast water immersion on 
recovery of sprint cycling performance, HR and, blood lactate.
METHODS: Two groups completed high-intensity sprint exercise before and after a 
30-min randomized recovery. The Wingate group (n = 8) performed 3 × 30-s Wingate 
tests (4-min rest periods). The repeated intermittent sprint group (n = 8) 
cycled for alternating 30-s periods at 40% of predetermined maximum power and 
120% maximum power, until exhaustion. Both groups completed three trials using a 
different recovery treatment for each trial (balanced randomized application). 
Recovery treatments were passive rest, 1:1 contrast water immersion (2.5 min of 
cold (8°C) to 2.5 min of hot (40°C)), and 1:4 contrast water immersion (1 min of 
cold to 4 min of hot). Blood lactate and HR were recorded throughout, and peak 
power and total work for pre- and postrecovery Wingate performance and exercise 
time and total work for repeated sprinting were recorded.
RESULTS: Recovery of Wingate peak power was 8% greater after 1:4 contrast water 
immersion than after passive rest, whereas both contrast water immersion ratios 
provided a greater recovery of exercise time (∼ 10%) and total work (∼ 14%) for 
repeated sprinting than for passive rest. Blood lactate was similar between 
trials. Compared with passive rest, HR initially declined more slowly during 
contrast water immersion but increased with each transition to a cold immersion 
phase.
CONCLUSIONS: These data support contrast water immersion being effective in 
maintaining performance during a short-term recovery from sprint exercise. This 
effect needs further investigation but is likely explained by cardiovascular 
mechanisms, shown here by an elevation in HR upon each cold immersion.

The aim of this study was to examine the effect of age and spa treatment (i.e. 
combined sauna, cold water immersion, and jacuzzi) on match running performance 
over two consecutive matches in highly trained young soccer players. Fifteen 
pre- (age 12.8 ± 0.6 years) and 13 post- (15.9 ± 1 y) peak height velocity (PHV) 
players played two matches (Matches 1 and 2) within 48 h against the same 
opposition, with no specific between-match recovery intervention (control). Five 
post-PHV players also completed another set of two consecutive matches, with spa 
treatment implemented after the first match. Match running performance was 
assessed using a global positioning system with very-high-intensity running (> 
16.1-19.0 km · h(-1)), sprinting distance (>19 km · h(-1)), and peak match speed 
determined. Match 2 very-high-intensity running was ""possibly"" impaired in 
post-PHV players (-9 ± 33%; ± 90% confidence limits), whereas it was ""very 
likely"" improved for the pre-PHV players (+27 ± 22%). The spa treatment had a 
beneficial impact on Match 2 running performance, with a ""likely"" rating for 
sprinting distance (+30 ± 67%) and ""almost certain"" for peak match speed (+6.4 ± 
3%). The results suggest that spa treatment is an effective recovery 
intervention for post-PHV players, while its value in pre-PHV players is 
questionable.

OBJECTIVE: We compared the use of two active cooling devices with passive 
cooling in a moderate-temperature (≈ 22 °C) environment on heart rate (HR) and 
core temperature (T(c)) recovery when applied to firefighters following 20 
minutes of fire suppression.
METHODS: Firefighters (23 men, two women) performed 20 minutes of fire 
suppression at a live-fire evolution. Immediately following the evolution, the 
subjects removed their thermal protective clothing and were randomized to 
receive forearm immersion (FI), ice water perfused cooling vest (CV), or passive 
(P) cooling in an air-conditioned medical trailer for 30 minutes. Heart rate and 
deep gastric temperature were monitored every 5 minutes during recovery.
RESULTS: A single 20-minute bout of fire suppression resulted in near-maximal 
mean ± standard deviation HR (175 ± 13 b min(-1), P; 172 ± 20 b·min(-1), FI; 177 
± 12 b·min(-1), CV) when compared with baseline (p < 0.001), a rapid and 
substantial rise in T(c) (38.2° ± 0.7°, P; 38.3° ± 0.4°, FI; 38.3° ± 0.3°, CV) 
compared with baseline (p < 0.001), and body mass lost from sweating of nearly 1 
kilogram. Cooling rates (°C·min) differed (p = 0.036) by device, with FI (0.05 ± 
0.04) providing higher rates than P (0.03 ± 0.02) or CV (0.03 ± 0.04), although 
differences over 30 minutes were small and recovery of body temperature was 
incomplete in all groups.
CONCLUSIONS: During 30 minutes of recovery following a 20-minute bout of fire 
suppression in a training academy setting, there is a slightly higher cooling 
rate for FI and no apparent benefit to CV when compared with P cooling in a 
moderate temperature environment.

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of cryotherapy, in the 
form of cold water immersion, on knee joint position sense. Fourteen healthy 
volunteers, with no previous knee injury or pre-existing clinical condition, 
participated in this randomized cross-over trial. The intervention consisted of 
a 30-min immersion, to the level of the umbilicus, in either cold (14 ± 1 °C) or 
tepid water (28 ± 1 °C). Approximately one week later, in a randomized fashion, 
the volunteers completed the remaining immersion. Active ipsilateral limb 
repositioning sense of the right knee was measured, using weight-bearing and 
non-weight-bearing assessments, employing video-recorded 3D motion analysis. 
These assessments were conducted immediately before and after a cold and tepid 
water immersion. No significant differences were found between treatments for 
the absolute (P = 0.29), relative (P = 0.21) or variable error (P = 0.86). The 
average effect size of the outcome measures was modest (range -0.49 to 0.9) and 
all the associated 95% confidence intervals for these effect sizes crossed zero. 
These results indicate that there is no evidence of an enhanced risk of injury, 
following a return to sporting activity, after cold water immersion.

The aim of this study was to assess the effects of a single session of cold or 
thermoneutral water immersion after a one-off match on muscular dysfunction and 
damage in soccer players. Twenty-male soccer players completed one match and 
were randomly divided into cryotherapy (10 min cold water immersion, 10°C, n = 
10) and thermoneutral (10 min thermoneutral water immersion, 35°C, n = 10) 
groups. Muscle damage (creatine kinase, myoglobin), inflammation (C-reactive 
protein), neuromuscular function (jump and sprint abilities and maximal 
isometric quadriceps strength), and delayed-onset muscle soreness were evaluated 
before, within 30 min of the end, and 24 and 48 h after the match. After the 
match, the players in both groups showed increased plasma creatine kinase 
activity (30 min, 24 h, 48 h), myoglobin (30 min) and C-reactive protein (30 
min, 24 h) concentrations. Peak jump ability and maximal strength were decreased 
and delayed-onset muscle soreness increased in both groups. However, 
differential alterations were observed between thermoneutral water and cold 
water immersion groups in creatine kinase (30 min, 24 h, 48 h), myoglobin (30 
min), C-reactive protein (30 min, 24 h, 48 h), quadriceps strength (24 h), and 
quadriceps (24 h), calf (24 h) and adductor (30 min) delayed-onset muscle 
soreness. The results suggest that cold water immersion immediately after a 
one-off soccer match reduces muscle damage and discomfort, possibly contributing 
to a faster recovery of neuromuscular function.

In order to investigate the effectiveness of different techniques of water 
immersion recovery on maximal strength, power and the post-exercise inflammatory 
response in elite athletes, 41 highly trained (Football, Rugby, Volleyball) male 
subjects (age = 21.5 ± 4.6 years, mass = 73.1 ± 9.7 kg and height = 176.7 ± 9.7 
cm) performed 20 min of exhaustive, intermittent exercise followed by a 15 min 
recovery intervention. The recovery intervention consisted of different water 
immersion techniques, including: temperate water immersion (36°C; TWI), cold 
water immersion (10°C; CWI), contrast water temperature (10-42°C; CWT) and a 
passive recovery (PAS). Performances during a maximal 30-s rowing test (P(30 
s)), a maximal vertical counter-movement jump (CMJ) and a maximal isometric 
voluntary contraction (MVC) of the knee extensor muscles were measured at rest 
(Pre-exercise), immediately after the exercise (Post-exercise), 1 h after (Post 
1 h) and 24 h later (Post 24 h). Leukocyte profile and venous blood markers of 
muscle damage (creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)) were also 
measured Pre-exercise, Post 1 h and Post 24 h. A significant time effect was 
observed to indicate a reduction in performance (Pre-exercise vs. Post-exercise) 
following the exercise bout in all conditions (P < 0.05). Indeed, at 1 h post 
exercise, a significant improvement in MVC and P(30 s) was respectively observed 
in the CWI and CWT groups compared to pre-exercise. Further, for the CWI group, 
this result was associated with a comparative blunting of the rise in total 
number of leucocytes at 1 h post and of plasma concentration of CK at 24 h post. 
The results indicate that the practice of cold water immersion and contrast 
water therapy are more effective immersion modalities to promote a faster acute 
recovery of maximal anaerobic performances (MVC and 30″ all-out respectively) 
after an intermittent exhaustive exercise. These results may be explained by the 
suppression of plasma concentrations of markers of inflammation and damage, 
suggesting reduced passive leakage from disrupted skeletal muscle, which may 
result in the increase in force production during ensuing bouts of exercise.

In the last years, phototherapy has becoming a promising tool to improve 
skeletal muscle recovery after exercise, however, it was not compared with other 
modalities commonly used with this aim. In the present study we compared the 
short-term effects of cold water immersion therapy (CWIT) and light emitting 
diode therapy (LEDT) with placebo LEDT on biochemical markers related to 
skeletal muscle recovery after high-intensity exercise. A randomized 
double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial was performed with six male 
young futsal athletes. They were treated with CWIT (5°C of temperature [SD 
±1°]), active LEDT (69 LEDs with wavelengths 660/850 nm, 10/30 mW of output 
power, 30 s of irradiation time per point, and 41.7 J of total energy irradiated 
per point, total of ten points irradiated) or an identical placebo LEDT 5 min 
after each of three Wingate cycle tests. Pre-exercise, post-exercise, and 
post-treatment measurements were taken of blood lactate levels, creatine kinase 
(CK) activity, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. There were no significant 
differences in the work performed during the three Wingate tests (p > 0.05). All 
biochemical parameters increased from baseline values (p < 0.05) after the three 
exercise tests, but only active LEDT decreased blood lactate levels (p = 0.0065) 
and CK activity (p = 0.0044) significantly after treatment. There were no 
significant differences in CRP values after treatments. We concluded that 
treating the leg muscles with LEDT 5 min after the Wingate cycle test seemed to 
inhibit the expected post-exercise increase in blood lactate levels and CK 
activity. This suggests that LEDT has better potential than 5 min of CWIT for 
improving short-term post-exercise recovery.

The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of a cold treatment and a 
dynamic warm-up on lower body power in the form of a countermovement vertical 
jump (CMVJ). Nine physically active men, who were either current or ex-National 
Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division 1 athletes, consented to 
participate in the study. Using a balanced, randomized presentation and a 
within-subject design, each subject performed 4 environmental and warm-up 
protocols (i.e., ambient temperature without warm-up, ambient temperature with 
warm-up, cold without warm-up, or cold with warm-up). Two sets of 3 maximal 
effort CMVJs were performed on a force plate at each testing time point. For 
each protocol, the subjects completed a pretest set of CMVJ (pretreatment 
[PRE]), were then exposed to 1 of the 2 temperature treatments, completed 
another set of CMVJ (initial [IT]), then either went through a 15-minute 
warm-up, or were asked to sit in place. Then a final set of CMVJs was completed 
(posttreatment [PT]). The primary finding in this study was that warm-up was 
effective in offsetting the negative effects of cold exposure on CMVJ power. 
There was a significant main effect for Time (PRE > PT > IT), and there was a 
significant (p ≤ 0.05) main effect for Trial (AMB = AMBWU > COLDWU > COLD). 
Because athletic competitions happen in various colder climates, it is important 
to make sure that a proper warm-up be completed to maximize the athlete's power 
output. The results of this study demonstrate that when athletes are exposed to 
cold conditions, it is recommended that before practice or play, a dynamic 
warm-up be employed to optimize performance.

Canada.

CONTEXT: Cold-water immersion is recommended for the immediate field treatment 
of exertional heat stroke. However, concerns exist over potential overcooling of 
hyperthermic individuals during cold-water immersion.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the recommendation that removing previously hyperthermic 
individuals from a cold-water bath at a rectal temperature (T(re)) of 38.6°C 
would attenuate overcooling.
DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study.
SETTING: University research laboratory.
PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 6 men and 4 women (age  =  
22 ± 3 years, height  =  172 ± 10 cm, mass  =  67.8 ± 10.7 kg, body fat 
percentage  =  17.1% ± 4.5%, maximum oxygen consumption  =  59.3 ± 8.7 
mL·kg(-1)·min(-1)).
INTERVENTION(S): After exercising at an ambient temperature of 40.0°C for 38.5 ± 
9.4 minutes, until T(re) reached 39.5°C, participants were immersed in a 2.0°C 
circulated water bath until T(re) decreased to either 37.5°C or 38.6°C. 
Subsequently, participants were removed from the water bath and recovered for 20 
minutes at an ambient temperature of 25°C.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Rectal and esophageal temperatures were measured 
continuously during the immersion and recovery periods.
RESULTS: Because of the experimental design, the overall time of immersion was 
greater during the 37.5°C trial (16.6 ± 5.7 minutes) than the 38.6°C trial (8.8 
± 2.6 minutes) (t(9)  =  -4.740, P  =  .001). During the recovery period after 
cold-water immersion, both rectal (F(1,9)  =  50.540, P < .001) and esophageal 
(F(1,6)  =  20.365, P  =  .007) temperatures remained greater in the 38.6°C 
trial than in the 37.5°C trial. This was evidenced by low points of 36.47°C ± 
0.70°C and 37.19°C ± 0.71°C for rectal temperature (t(9)  =  2.975, P  =  .016) 
and of 35.67°C ± 1.27°C and 36.72°C ± 0.95°C for esophageal temperature (t(6) 
 =  3.963, P  =  .007) during the recovery period of the 37.5°C and 38.6°C 
trials, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Immersion for approximately 9 minutes to a rectal temperature 
cooling limit of 38.6°C negated any risk associated with overcooling 
hyperthermic individuals when they were immersed in 2°C water.

Australia, Perth, Western Australia, Australia. halser01@student.uwa.edu.au

PURPOSE: The performance of exercise while immersed in cold water has been shown 
to influence energy intake in the subsequent meal. In addition, cold water 
immersion (CWI) itself has been shown to reduce the concentration of the hormone 
leptin, high concentrations of which signal satiety. Taken together, these 
findings raise the question of whether the common practice of postexercise CWI 
by athletes acutely affects energy intake. Hence, this study investigated the 
acute effect of CWI after exercise on subsequent energy intake and macronutrient 
preferences as well as the circulating levels of a range of appetite-related 
hormones.
METHODS: Ten physically active men participated in three randomized, 
counterbalanced trials consisting of 40 min of treadmill running (70% 
VO(2peak)), followed by 20 min of CWI (15°C), neutral water immersion (NWI; 
33°C), or a resting control with no immersion (CON). Participants were then 
given a 30-min access to a buffet-type breakfast of precisely known quantity and 
nutrient composition from which they could consume ad libitum.
RESULTS: Participants consumed significantly more energy after both CWI (mean ± 
SD = 4893 ± 1554 kJ, P = 0.006) and NWI (5167 ± 1975 kJ, P = 0.010) compared 
with CON (4089 ± 1585 kJ). However, there was no significant difference in total 
energy intake between the CWI and the NWI trials (P = 0.595). These changes were 
associated with a significant interaction effect of time and trial on both 
leptin (P = 0.045) and active ghrelin (P = 0.046).
CONCLUSION: Postexercise water immersion is associated with higher energy intake 
in the subsequent meal compared with CON. This is an important consideration for 
trained men using water immersion as a method of recovery from exercise.

Australia.

PURPOSE: To develop and investigate the efficacy of a new precooling strategy 
combining external and internal techniques on the performance of a cycling time 
trial (TT) in a hot and humid environment.
METHODS: Eleven well-trained male cyclists undertook three trials of a 
laboratory-based cycling TT simulating the course characteristics of the Beijing 
Olympic Games event in a controlled hot and humid environment (32°C-35°C at 
50%-60% relative humidity). The trials, separated by 3-7 d, were undertaken in a 
randomized crossover design and consisted of the following: 1) CON-no treatment 
apart from the ad libitum consumption of cold water (4°C), 2) STD 
COOL-whole-body immersion in cold (10°C) water for 10 min followed by wearing a 
cooling jacket, or 3) NEW COOL-combination of consumption of 14 g of ice slurry 
(""slushie"") per kilogram body mass made from a commercial sports drink while 
applying iced towels.
RESULTS: There was an observable effect on rectal temperature (T(rec)) before 
the commencement of the TT after both precooling techniques (STD COOL < NEW COOL 
< CON, P < 0.05), but pacing of the TT resulted in similar T(rec), HR, and RPE 
throughout the cycling protocol in all trials. NEW COOL was associated with a 
3.0% increase in power (approximately 8 W) and a 1.3% improvement in performance 
time (approximately 1:06 min) compared with the CON trial, with the true likely 
effects ranging from a trivial to a large benefit. The effect of the STD COOL 
trial compared with the CON trial was ""unclear.""
CONCLUSIONS: This new precooling strategy represents a practical and effective 
technique that could be used by athletes in preparation for endurance events 
undertaken in hot and humid conditions.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of cold and thermoneutral water 
immersion on post-exercise parasympathetic reactivation, inferred from heart 
rate (HR) recovery (HRR) and HR variability (HRV) indices. Twelve men performed, 
on three separate occasions, an intermittent exercise bout (all-out 30-s Wingate 
test, 5 min seated recovery, followed by 5 min of submaximal running exercise), 
randomly followed by 5 min of passive (seated) recovery under either cold (CWI), 
thermoneutral water immersion (TWI) or control (CON) conditions. HRR indices 
(e.g., heart beats recovered in the first minute after exercise cessation, 
HRR(60)(s)) and vagal-related HRV indices (i.e., natural logarithm of the square 
root of the mean of the sum of the squares of differences between adjacent 
normal R-R intervals (Ln rMSSD)) were calculated for the three recovery 
conditions. HRR(60)(s) was faster in water immersion compared with CON 
conditions [30+/-9 beats min(-)(1) for CON vs. 43+/- 10 beats min(-)(1) for TWI 
(P=0.003) and 40+/-13 beats min(-)(1) for CWI (P=0.017)], while no difference 
was found between CWI and TWI (P=0.763). Ln rMSSD was higher in CWI (2.32+/-0.67 
ms) compared with CON (1.98+/-0.74 ms, P=0.05) and TWI (2.01+/-0.61 ms, P=0.08; 
aES=1.07) conditions, with no difference between CON and TWI (P=0.964). Water 
immersion is a simple and efficient means of immediately triggering 
post-exercise parasympathetic activity, with colder immersion temperatures 
likely to be more effective at increasing parasympathetic activity.

Effect of cold water immersion on repeated cycling performance and limb blood 
flow.

Capital Territory, Australia.

The purpose of the present study was to compare the effects of cold water 
immersion (CWI) and active recovery (ACT) on resting limb blood flow, rectal 
temperature and repeated cycling performance in the heat. Ten subjects completed 
two testing sessions separated by 1 week; each trial consisted of an initial 
all-out 35-min exercise bout, one of two 15-min recovery interventions 
(randomised: CWI or ACT), followed by a 40-min passive recovery period before 
repeating the 35-min exercise bout. Performance was measured as the change in 
total work completed during the exercise bouts. Resting limb blood flow, heart 
rate, rectal temperature and blood lactate were recorded throughout the testing 
sessions. There was a significant decline in performance after ACT (mean (SD) 
-1.81% (1.05%)) compared with CWI where performance remained unchanged (0.10% 
(0.71%)). Rectal temperature was reduced after CWI (36.8°C (1.0°C)) compared 
with ACT (38.3°C (0.4°C)), as was blood flow to the arms (CWI 3.64 (1.47) ml/100 
ml/min; ACT 16.85 (3.57) ml/100 ml/min) and legs (CW 4.83 (2.49) ml/100 ml/min; 
ACT 4.83 (2.49) ml/100 ml/min). Leg blood flow at the end of the second exercise 
bout was not different between the active (15.25 (4.33) ml/100 ml/min) and cold 
trials (14.99 (4.96) ml/100 ml/min), whereas rectal temperature (CWI 38.1°C 
(0.3°C); ACT 38.8°C (0.2°C)) and arm blood flow (CWI 20.55 (3.78) ml/100 ml/min; 
ACT 23.83 (5.32) ml/100 ml/min) remained depressed until the end of the cold 
trial. These findings indicate that CWI is an effective intervention for 
maintaining repeat cycling performance in the heat and this performance benefit 
is associated with alterations in core temperature and limb blood flow.

BACKGROUND: It is well known that reducing tissue temperature changes sensory 
and motor nerve conduction. However, few studies have compared the effect of 
different cold modalities on nerve conduction parameters.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of ice pack, ice 
massage, and cold water immersion on the conduction parameters of the sural 
(sensorial) and tibial motor nerves.
DESIGN: An experimental study was conducted in which the participants were 
randomly assigned to 1 of 3 intervention groups (n=12 per group). Independent 
variables were cold modality and pre- and post-cooling measurement time. 
Dependent variables were skin temperature and nerve conduction parameters.
METHODS: Thirty-six people who were healthy, with a mean (SD) age of 20.5 (1.9) 
years, participated in the study. Each group received 1 of the 3 cold 
modalities, applied to the right calf region for 15 minutes. Skin temperature 
and nerve conduction parameters were measured before and immediately after 
cooling.
RESULTS: All 3 modalities reduced skin temperature (mean=18.2 degrees C). There 
also was a reduction in amplitude and an increase in latency and duration of the 
compound action potential. Ice massage, ice pack, and cold water immersion 
reduced sensory nerve conduction velocity (NCV) by 20.4, 16.7, and 22.6 m/s and 
motor NCV by 2.5, 2.1, and 8.3 m/s, respectively. Cold water immersion was the 
most effective modality in changing nerve conduction parameters.
LIMITATIONS: The cooling area of the ice massage and ice pack was smaller than 
that of the cold water immersion. The examiner was not blinded to the treatment 
group. The population included only participants who were healthy and young.
CONCLUSIONS: All 3 modalities were effective in reducing skin temperature and 
changing sensory conduction at a physiological level that is sufficient to 
induce a hypoalgesic effect. The results suggest that cold water immersion, as 
applied in this study, is the most indicated modality for inducing therapeutic 
effects associated with the reduction of motor nerve conduction.

The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of cold water immersion 
(CWI) on sprint swimming performance in simulated competition conditions. Ten 
well-trained swimmers (5 males, 5 females; 19.0 +/- 3.9 years) performed two 
100-m swimming sprints (S1 and S2) interspersed with a 30-min passive recovery 
period, during which athletes were randomly assigned to 5 min of CWI (14 degrees 
C) or an out-of-water control condition (CON 28 degrees C). During tests, sprint 
times, heart rate (HR), pre- and post-race parasympathetic activity via HR 
variability (natural logarithm of the square root of the mean of the sum of the 
squares of differences between adjacent normal R-R intervals; Ln rMSSD) and 
blood lactate accumulation ([La](ac)) and clearance ([La](cle)) were recorded. 
Rates of perceived recovery (RPR) and exertion (RPE) were evaluated before and 
after each sprint. CWI was associated with a 'likely' decrease in swimming 
performance [1.8% (90% CI 0.2, 3.5)], as well as 'likely' lower peak HR [-1.9% 
(-3.6, -0.2)]. CWI was also associated with a 'likely' smaller decrease in Ln 
rMSSD after the first sprint [-16.7% (-30.9, -4.1)]. RPR was 'likely' better 
[+27.2% (-3.7, 68.0)] following CWI. 'unclear' effects were observed for 
[La](ac) [+24.7% (-13.4, 79.5)], [La](cle) [-7.6% (-24.2, 12.7)] or RPE [+2.0% 
(-12.3, 18.5)]. Following CWI, changes in sprint times were 'largely' correlated 
with changes in peak HR (r = 0.80). Despite a subjective perception of improved 
recovery following CWI, this recovery intervention resulted in slower swimming 
times in well-trained athletes swimming in simulated competition conditions.

This study compared the effects of hot/cold water immersion, static stretching, 
and no recovery (control) interventions on leg strength, rowing performance, and 
indicators of muscle soreness/damage in the 72 hours following strenuous 
stair-climb running. Club (n = 14) and elite (Sports Institute) (n = 6) rowers 
performed the training run on three separate occasions. After each run, 
participants completed a randomly assigned 15-minute recovery treatment, either 
hot/cold, static stretching, or control, which were repeated at 24 and 48 hours 
postrun. No significant strength or performance differences existed between the 
three recovery treatments for either group. Muscle soreness for both groups 
remained significantly elevated (p < 0.05) above baseline at 72 hours postrun. 
At 48-hours postrun serum creatine kinase levels had returned to baseline and at 
72 hours postrun were below baseline in both groups. In conclusion, neither 
hot/cold nor static stretching accelerated recovery at 72 hours beyond that 
achieved by the control condition.

PURPOSE: This study investigated the effects of precooling on performance and 
pacing during self-paced endurance cycling in the heat and, further, the effects 
of cooling on contractile function as a mechanism for performance changes.
METHODS: After familiarization, eight male cyclists performed two randomized 
40-min time trials on a cycle ergometer in 33 degrees C. Before the time trials, 
participants underwent either a 20-min lower-body cold-water immersion procedure 
or no cooling intervention. Before and after the intervention and the time 
trial, voluntary force (maximal voluntary contraction (MVC)), superimposed force 
(SIF), evoked twitch force (peak twitch force (Pf)), muscle temperature, and 
blood metabolites were measured. Further, measures of core and skin temperature 
and HR were recorded before, during, and after cooling and time trial.
RESULTS: Results indicated that cycling performance was improved with precooling 
(198 +/- 25 vs 178 +/- 26 W for precooling and control, respectively; P = 0.05). 
Although core, muscle, skin, and mean body temperatures were lower in the 
cooling condition until the 20th minute (P < 0.05), performance did not differ 
until the last 10 min of the time trial, by which time no differences in 
physiological measures were present. Further, while MVC and SIF were reduced 
postexercise in both conditions, MVC, SIF, and Pf were not different between 
conditions preexercise or postexercise.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, a precooling intervention improved self-paced 
endurance exercise; however, the improvement in performance became evident after 
measured physiological differences induced by precooling had dissipated. 
Further, the lack of difference between conditions in MVC, SIF, or Pf indicates 
that improvements in performance did not result from an improvement in 
contractile function, suggesting that improvements may result from other 
mechanisms such as muscle recruitment.

The purpose of this study was to compare four recovery interventions following 
simulated team sport, intermittent-sprint exercise on consecutive days. Ten 
female netball players performed four randomized sessions of a simulated netball 
exercise circuit on consecutive days. Each condition consisted of two identical 
sessions (Session 1 and 2), with the recovery intervention implemented at the 
completion of Session 1. Participants performed all interventions involving: 
passive recovery, active recovery (ACT), cold water immersion (CWI) and contrast 
water therapy (C(T)WT). No significant differences (p > 0.05) were evident 
between conditions for exercise performance (vertical jump, 20-m sprint, 10-m 
sprint, total circuit time) during Session 2. Effect size data indicated trends 
for an ameliorated decline in 5 x 20-m sprints and vertical jump for C(T)WT and 
CWI, respectively. C(T)WT demonstrated a significant reduction (p = 0.04) in 
lactate post-intervention compared to ACT recovery. Further, ACT recovery 
resulted in a significantly elevated (p < 0.01) heart rate compared to all other 
conditions postintervention and demonstrated significantly higher (p < 0.01) 
rating of perceived exertion postintervention and muscle soreness pre-exercise 
Session 2. It is likely that while interventions may be applicable to team sport 
practices, the 24-hour recovery period between exercise bouts was sufficient to 
allow performance to be maintained, regardless of recovery interventions.

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of 3 post-match recovery 
modalities on physical performance, physiological measures, and players' 
perceptions of recovery after 90-minute soccer match play. On separate days, 28 
young (age: 14.3 +/- 0.7 years) soccer players played 3 soccer matches each 
randomly followed by 1 of 3 recovery modalities: (a) CONT-cold (12 degrees C) 
water immersion and hot (38 degrees C) shower, (b) COMB-cold water immersion and 
active recovery using a cycle ergometer, and (c) PASS-a passive post-match 
routine (stretching and leg raise). Performance (vertical jump height), 
physiological (heart rate and tympanic temperature), and perceptual measures 
(perceived quality of recovery) were determined before each match, 10 minutes 
after each match, after each recovery method, and after 24 hours. There was a 
0.6 +/- 6.7% drop in immediately after a match, but there was no difference in 
vertical jump height after 24 hours (p = 0.997). Perceived quality of recovery 
immediately after COMB was substantially higher than CONT and PASS, but the 
effect did not last more than 24 hours. The players perceived lighter legs after 
COMB, compared with the PASS, at post-24 hours. In conclusion, a combined 
recovery modality (cold water immersion and active recovery) after a soccer 
match did not have a substantial effect on vertical jump height performance when 
compared with contrast water immersion and passive recovery alone. However, the 
observed positive effects on perceived recovery (higher quality of recovery and 
lighter legs) after the combined modality (cold water immersion and active 
recovery) suggest that this approach may be effective for young players after 
intense soccer match play.

(1)Laboratory of Human Movement Studies, EA3608, Faculty of Sport Sciences and 
Physical Education, Lille 2 University, France.

PURPOSE: Considering the development of rock climbing as a competitive sport, we 
aimed at investigating the influence of four recovery methods on subsequent 
maximal climbing performance.
METHODS: In a randomly assigned crossover design, 13 female well-trained 
climbers (27.1 +/- 8.9 yr) came to the climbing center on four occasions 
separated by 1 wk. On each occasion, they had to perform two climbing tests (C1 
and C2) until volitional exhaustion on a prepracticed route (overhanging wall, 
level 6b). These two tests were separated by 20 min of recovery. Four recovery 
methods were used in randomized order: passive recovery, active recovery (cycle 
ergometer, 30-40 W), electromyostimulation on the forearm muscles (bisymmetric 
TENS current), or cold water immersion of the forearms and arms (three periods 
of 5 min at 15 +/- 1 degrees C). Climbing tests' performance was reflected by 
the number of arm movements and climb duration.
RESULTS: Using active recovery and cold water immersion, performance at C2 was 
maintained in comparison with C1, whereas C2 performance was impaired compared 
with C1 (P< 0.01) using electromyostimulation and passive recovery (recovery 
method-by-climb interaction, P < 0.05). Blood lactate decreased during recovery, 
with the greatest decrease occurring during active recovery (time-by-recovery 
method interaction, P < 0.001). Arms and forearms' skin temperatures were lower 
throughout the cold water immersion compared with the other three methods (P < 
0.001).
CONCLUSION: Active recovery and cold water immersion are two means of preserving 
performance when repeating acute exhausting climbing trails in female climbers. 
These positive effects are accompanied by a greater lactate removal and a 
decrease in subcutaneous tissues temperatures, respectively.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of a single bout of 
cold-water immersion on recovery from exercise-induced muscle damage. Eighteen 
physically active female volunteers (age 19.9 (+/-0.97 years), height 1.66 
(+/-0.05 m), mass 63.7 (+/-10 kg), completed 10 sets of 10 counter-movement 
jumps to induce muscle damage and were randomly allocated to a control or 
treatment group. The treatment group was given a single 10-min bout of lower 
limb cold-water immersion therapy at 10 degrees C immediately following 
damage-inducing exercise. Indicators of muscle damage (plasma creatine kinase 
activity, perceived soreness and maximal voluntary contraction of the 
quadriceps) were assessed immediately prior to counter-movement jumps, and at 1, 
24, 48, 72 and 96 h, following the damaging exercise. Significant (p = 0.05) 
time effects were recorded on all indicators of muscle damage, but there were no 
significant group or group x time interaction effects found on any of the 
measured variables. The results indicate that a single bout of cold-water 
immersion after a damaging bout of exercise has no beneficial effects on the 
recovery from exercise-induced muscle damage.

Dammam, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of physical and mental stressors on pressure 
pain threshold (PPT), and pressure pain tolerance (PTOL) values, and to compare 
these different types of stressors on its ability to affect PPT and PTOL values 
in young women. We also correlated body mass index (BMI) with PPT and PTOL in 
young women.
METHODS: This was a self-controlled study carried out on 79 second-year female 
medical students in the Department of Physiology, King Faisal University, 
Dammam, Saudi Arabia during the year 2007. The students were assessed before, 
and after they were subjected to a mental (exam), and 2 physical stressors. 
Measurements of PPT and PTOL were carried out using a pressure algometer. The 2 
physical stressors used were: cold water immersion and isometric exercise (ISO 
EX) with a dynamometer. Students' body mass indices were measured in addition to 
the measurement of blood pressure and heart rate for each student before, and 
after exposure to the stressors.
RESULTS: All 3 stressors significantly increased the PPT values (p=0.000). The 
PTOL was also significantly increased immediately after exposure to the physical 
stressors (p=0.000), while for the mental stressor, the PTOL readings were not 
significantly increased. Among the 3 types of stressors, the cold water 
immersion was the most effective in increasing PPT and PTOL. Moreover, a 
significant (p=0.009) negative correlation was demonstrated between the BMI and 
PTOL readings.
CONCLUSION: Various types of physical and mental stressors significantly 
increased PPT and PTOL readings in young female adults, in addition to the 
significant findings that students with higher body mass indices tolerated pain 
less.

The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of two practical precooling 
techniques (skin cooling vs. skin + core cooling) on cycling time trial 
performance in warm conditions. Six trained cyclists completed one maximal 
graded exercise test (VO2(peak) 71.4 +/- 3.2 ml x kg(-1) x min(-1)) and four 
approximately 40 min laboratory cycling time trials in a heat chamber (34.3 
degrees C +/- 1.1 degrees C; 41.2% +/- 3.0% rh) using a 
fixed-power/variable-power format. Cyclists prepared for the time trial using 
three techniques administered in a randomised order prior to the warm-up: (1) no 
cooling (control), (2) cooling jacket for 40 min (jacket) or (3) 30-min water 
immersion followed by a cooling jacket application for 40 min (combined). Rectal 
temperature prior to the time trial was 37.8 degrees C +/- 0.1 degrees C in 
control, similar in jacket (37.8 degrees C +/- 0.3 degrees C) and lower in 
combined (37.1 degrees C +/- 0.2 degrees C, P < 0.01). Compared with the control 
trial, time trial performance was not different for jacket precooling (-16 +/- 
36 s, -0.7%; P = 0.35) but was faster for combined precooling (-42 +/- 25 s, - 
.8%; P = 0.009). In conclusion, a practical combined precooling strategy that 
involves immersion in cool water followed by the use of a cooling jacket can 
produce decrease in rectal temperature that persist throughout a warm-up and 
improve laboratory cycling time trial performance in warm conditions.

INTRODUCTION: Patient cooling time can impact upon the prognosis of heat 
illness. Although ice-cold-water immersion will rapidly extract heat, access to 
ice or cold water may be limited in hot climates. Indeed, some have concerns 
regarding the sudden cold-water immersion of hyperthermic individuals, whereas 
others believe that cutaneous vasoconstriction may reduce convective heat 
transfer from the core. It was hypothesized that warmer immersion temperatures, 
which induce less powerful vasoconstriction, may still facilitate rapid cooling 
in hyperthermic individuals.
METHODS: Eight males participated in three trials and were heated to an 
esophageal temperature of 39.5 degrees C by exercising in the heat (36 degrees 
C, 50% relative humidity) while wearing a water-perfusion garment (40 degrees 
C). Subjects were cooled using each of the following methods: air (20-22 degrees 
C), cold-water immersion (14 degrees C), and temperate-water immersion (26 
degrees C).
RESULTS: The time to reach an esophageal temperature of 37.5 degrees C averaged 
22.81 min (air), 2.16 min (cold), and 2.91 min (temperate). Whereas each of the 
between-trial comparisons was statistically significant (P < 0.05), cooling in 
temperate water took only marginally longer than that in cold water, and one 
cannot imagine that the 45-s cooling time difference would have any meaningful 
physiological or clinical implications.
CONCLUSION: It is assumed that this rapid heat loss was due to a less powerful 
peripheral vasoconstrictor response, with central heat being more rapidly 
transported to the skin surface for dissipation. Although the core-to-water 
thermal gradient was much smaller with temperate-water cooling, greater skin and 
deeper tissue blood flows would support a superior convective heat delivery. 
Thus, a sustained physiological mechanism (blood flow) appears to have countered 
a less powerful thermal gradient, resulting in clinically insignificant 
differences in heat extraction between the cold and temperate cooling trials.

Effect on sport hemolysis of cold water leg immersion in athletes after training 
sessions.

The principal source of increased turnover of erythrocytes in athletes is sport 
hemolysis, the intravascular hemolysis that characteristically occurs with 
athletic performance in sport. The use of the parameter mean sphered cell volume 
(MSCV), automatically measured by means of the Coulter LH750, could be useful 
for diagnosing the presence of sport hemolysis. We studied the behavior of MSCV 
and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) in 30 top-level rugby players who underwent a 
heavy training session followed by 3 different recovery methods, administered to 
3 subgroups of 10 athletes. We tested the use of active recovery consisting of 
cold water (5 degrees C) immersion of legs for 10 minutes either before (n = 10) 
or after (n = 10) cycling at 180 W for 10 minutes. In the whole group of 
athletes, measurements performed at rest and after training session and recovery 
showed no differences in MCV and MSCV values. The difference between MCV and 
MSCV was significant in the whole group and in the subgroup performing passive 
recovery, whereas the difference was not significant in the subgroups performing 
active recovery. This finding indicates that the use of active recovery in the 
top-level rugby players prevented the modifications of erythrocyte volume and 
shape. We outline that the values of the difference between MCV and MSCV was 
significantly modified in the whole group but the variations were not 
significant in the active recovery subgroups. The use of an index of erythrocyte 
shape modification (MCV - MSCV) can be very useful for evaluating sport 
hemolysis.

This study aimed to compare the efficacy of hot/cold contrast water immersion 
(CWI), cold-water immersion (COLD) and no recovery treatment (control) as 
post-exercise recovery methods following exhaustive simulated team sports 
exercise. Repeated sprint ability, strength, muscle soreness and inflammatory 
markers were measured across the 48-h post-exercise period. Eleven male 
team-sport athletes completed three 3-day testing trials, each separated by 2 
weeks. On day 1, baseline measures of performance (10 m x 20 m sprints and 
isometric strength of quadriceps, hamstrings and hip flexors) were recorded. 
Participants then performed 80 min of simulated team sports exercise followed by 
a 20-m shuttle run test to exhaustion. Upon completion of the exercise, and 24h 
later, participants performed one of the post-exercise recovery procedures for 
15 min. At 48 h post-exercise, the performance tests were repeated. Blood 
samples and muscle soreness ratings were taken before and immediately after 
post-exercise, and at 24h and 48 h post-exercise. In comparison to the control 
and CWI treatments, COLD resulted in significantly lower (p<0.05) muscle 
soreness ratings, as well as in reduced decrements to isometric leg extension 
and flexion strength in the 48-h post-exercise period. COLD also facilitated a 
more rapid return to baseline repeated sprint performances. The only benefit of 
CWI over control was a significant reduction in muscle soreness 24h 
post-exercise. This study demonstrated that COLD following exhaustive simulated 
team sports exercise offers greater recovery benefits than CWI or control 
treatments.

To assess the effect of cold water immersion and active recovery on 
thermoregulation and repeat cycling performance in the heat, ten well-trained 
male cyclists completed five trials, each separated by one week. Each trial 
consisted of a 30-min exercise task, one of five 15-min recoveries (intermittent 
cold water immersion in 10 degrees C, 15 degrees C and 20 degrees C water, 
continuous cold water immersion in 20 degrees C water or active recovery), 
followed by 40 min passive recovery, before repeating the 30-min exercise task. 
Recovery strategy effectiveness was assessed via changes in total work in the 
second exercise task compared with that in the first. Following active recovery, 
a mean 4.1% (s = 1.8) less total work (P = 0.00) was completed in the second 
than in the first exercise task. However, no significant differences in total 
work were observed between any of the cold water immersion protocols. Core and 
skin temperature, blood lactate concentration, heart rate, rating of thermal 
sensation, and rating of perceived exertion were recorded. During both exercise 
tasks there were no significant differences in blood lactate concentration 
between interventions; however, following active recovery blood lactate 
concentration was significantly lower (P < 0.05; 2.0 +/- 0.8 mmol . l(-1)) 
compared with all cold water immersion protocols. All cold water immersion 
protocols were effective in reducing thermal strain and were more effective in 
maintaining subsequent high-intensity cycling performance than active recovery.

The present study investigated the effects of three hydrotherapy interventions 
on next day performance recovery following strenuous training. Twelve cyclists 
completed four experimental trials differing only in 14-min recovery 
intervention: cold water immersion (CWI), hot water immersion (HWI), contrast 
water therapy (CWT), or passive recovery (PAS). Each trial comprised five 
consecutive exercise days of 105-min duration, including 66 maximal effort 
sprints. Additionally, subjects performed a total of 9-min sustained effort 
(time trial - TT). After completing each exercise session, athletes performed 
one of four recovery interventions (randomly assigned to each trial). 
Performance (average power), core temperature, heart rate (HR), and rating of 
perceived exertion (RPE) were recorded throughout each session. Sprint (0.1 - 
2.2 %) and TT (0.0 - 1.7 %) performance were enhanced across the five-day trial 
following CWI and CWT, when compared to HWI and PAS. Additionally, differences 
in rectal temperature were observed between interventions immediately and 15-min 
post-recovery; however, no significant differences were observed in HR or RPE 
regardless of day of trial/intervention. Overall, CWI and CWT appear to improve 
recovery from high-intensity cycling when compared to HWI and PAS, with athletes 
better able to maintain performance across a five-day period.

This study independently examined the effects of three hydrotherapy 
interventions on the physiological and functional symptoms of delayed onset 
muscle soreness (DOMS). Strength trained males (n = 38) completed two 
experimental trials separated by 8 months in a randomised crossover design; one 
trial involved passive recovery (PAS, control), the other a specific 
hydrotherapy protocol for 72 h post-exercise; either: (1) cold water immersion 
(CWI: n = 12), (2) hot water immersion (HWI: n = 11) or (3) contrast water 
therapy (CWT: n = 15). For each trial, subjects performed a DOMS-inducing leg 
press protocol followed by PAS or one of the hydrotherapy interventions for 14 
min. Weighted squat jump, isometric squat, perceived pain, thigh girths and 
blood variables were measured prior to, immediately after, and at 24, 48 and 72 
h post-exercise. Squat jump performance and isometric force recovery were 
significantly enhanced (P < 0.05) at 24, 48 and 72 h post-exercise following CWT 
and at 48 and 72 h post-exercise following CWI when compared to PAS. Isometric 
force recovery was also greater (P < 0.05) at 24, 48, and 72 h post-exercise 
following HWI when compared to PAS. Perceived pain improved (P < 0.01) following 
CWT at 24, 48 and 72 h post-exercise. Overall, CWI and CWT were found to be 
effective in reducing the physiological and functional deficits associated with 
DOMS, including improved recovery of isometric force and dynamic power and a 
reduction in localised oedema. While HWI was effective in the recovery of 
isometric force, it was ineffective for recovery of all other markers compared 
to PAS.

The aim of this study was to assess the effects of cold-water immersion 
(cryotherapy) on indices of muscle damage following a bout of prolonged 
intermittent exercise. Twenty males (mean age 22.3 years, s = 3.3; height 1.80 
m, s = 0.05; body mass 83.7 kg, s = 11.9) completed a 90-min intermittent 
shuttle run previously shown to result in marked muscle damage and soreness. 
After exercise, participants were randomly assigned to either 10 min cold-water 
immersion (mean 10 degrees C, s = 0.5) or a non-immersion control group. Ratings 
of perceived soreness, changes in muscular function and efflux of intracellular 
proteins were monitored before exercise, during treatment, and at regular 
intervals up to 7 days post-exercise. Exercise resulted in severe muscle 
soreness, temporary muscular dysfunction, and elevated serum markers of muscle 
damage, all peaking within 48 h after exercise. Cryotherapy administered 
immediately after exercise reduced muscle soreness at 1, 24, and 48 h (P < 
0.05). Decrements in isometric maximal voluntary contraction of the knee flexors 
were reduced after cryotherapy treatment at 24 (mean 12%, s(x) = 4) and 48 h 
(mean 3%, s(x) = 3) compared with the control group (mean 21%, s(x) = 5 and mean 
14%, s(x) = 5 respectively; P < 0.05). Exercise-induced increases in serum 
myoglobin concentration and creatine kinase activity peaked at 1 and 24 h, 
respectively (P < 0.05). Cryotherapy had no effect on the creatine kinase 
response, but reduced myoglobin 1 h after exercise (P < 0.05). The results 
suggest that cold-water immersion immediately after prolonged intermittent 
shuttle running reduces some indices of exercise-induced muscle damage.

INTRODUCTION: This study evaluated performance after lowering core temperature 
at different rates while local tissues were either cooled (lower body) or not 
cooled (upper body).
METHODS: There were 10 men who volunteered to perform up to 8 cold water 
immersions (CWI) at combinations of 2 water temperatures (10 degrees C and 15 
degrees C), 2 depths [waist (W), chest (C)], and 2 walking speeds (0.44 or 0.88 
m x s(-1)) until their core temperature fell to 35.5 degrees C, stabilized above 
that temperature, or they requested to stop. They also completed a control trial 
(120 min rest in 19 degrees C air). Immediately following each CWI and control, 
cognitive and physical performance tests were performed in cold air (10 degrees 
C; CAE).
RESULTS: Overall, the CWI protocol lowered rectal temperature by 0.3-1.0 degrees 
C. Mean skin temperature was approximately 26 degrees C and finger temperature 
was approximately 15 degrees C during CAE. No statistical differences were 
observed across trials for any cognitive test. On the physical performance 
tests, step test performance was degraded approximately 12% on CWI trials 
compared with control, but there were no differences in manual dexterity, hand 
grip strength, marksmanship, or pull-ups.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that cognitive performance can be maintained 
despite mild hypothermia, and that physical performance is related to local 
tissue temperature, not a moderately reduced core temperature.

This study investigated the effects of cold water immersion on recovery from 
anaerobic cycling. Seventeen (13 male, 4 female) active subjects underwent a 
crossover, randomised design involving two testing sessions 2 - 6 d apart. 
Testing involved two 30-s maximal cycling efforts separated by a one-hour 
recovery period of 10-min cycling warm-down followed by either passive rest or 
15-min cold water immersion (13 - 14 degrees C) with passive rest. Peak power, 
total work and postexercise blood lactate were significantly reduced following 
cold water immersion compared to the first exercise test and the control 
condition. These variables did not differ significantly between the control 
tests. Peak exercise heart rate was significantly lower after cold water 
immersion compared to the control. Time to peak power, rating of perceived 
exertion, and blood pH were not affected by cold water immersion compared to the 
control. Core temperature rose significantly (0.3 degrees C) during ice bath 
immersion but a similar increase also occurred in the control condition. 
Therefore, cold water immersion caused a significant decrease in sprint cycling 
performance with one-hour recovery between tests.

The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of two recovery 
techniques on blood lactate and repeated sprint performance. In a randomised 
cross-over design 20 junior representative rugby players (aged 19+/-1 years) 
were given either contrast temperature water therapy or active recovery after 
performing a repeated sprint test. The test was then repeated 1h later to gauge 
the effects of the two recovery methods on subsequent repetitive sprinting 
performance. One week later, the two groups were reversed and the testing 
repeated. The test consisted of ten 40-m sprints with a 30-s turn-around between 
sprints. Recovery consisted of 6 min slow jogging (6.8 km h(-1)) for the active 
recovery group or 6 min of contrast temperature water therapy consisting of 
three 1-min hip-height immersions in cold water (8-10 degrees C) alternated with 
three 1-min hot water (38 degrees C) showers. Blood lactate concentration and 
heart rates were measured throughout the testing. Relative to the active 
recovery group the contrast temperature water therapy group showed a substantial 
decrease in blood lactate concentration 3 min after the procedure (-2.1 mmol 
L(-1), 95% confidence limits, +/-1.8 mmol L(-1)), and substantially lower heart 
rates both during the procedure (-9.1+/-8.7 min(-1)) as well as 1h later during 
the second set of sprints (-11.7+/-8.6 min(-1)). Effects of recovery group on 
repeated sprint performance were small to trivial and unclear. Compared to 
active recovery, contrast temperature water therapy decreases blood lactate 
concentration and heart rate but has little effect on subsequent repetitive 
sprinting performance.

The benefits of rapid recovery after intense exercise are widely recognised, and 
lactate elimination is one indicator of recovery rate. This study examined the 
effect of contrast (alternating hot and cold) water immersion (CWI) on the rate 
of plasma lactate decrease during recovery after intense anaerobic exercise. 
Eleven subjects on each of two occasions undertook four successive 30-s Wingate 
tests separated by 30-s rest periods. On each occasion, plasma lactate 
concentration during recovery was measured 5 min post-exercise and thereafter at 
5 min intervals for 30 min. On one occasion (determined randomly), the subjects 
recovered passively (PR) on a recovery bed and, on the other, they alternated 
partial body immersion in hot (36 degrees C) and cold (12 degrees C) water 
baths. Plasma lactate concentrations were analysed by repeated measures analysis 
of variance and by fitting a linear regression model, allowing for both gender 
and recovery mode differences. The rate of decrease in plasma lactate 
concentration over the 30-min recovery period was significantly higher (p<0.001) 
in CWI; 0.28(+/-0.02) mmol L(-1) min(-1) (CWI) compared to 0.22(+/-0.02) mmol 
L(-1) min(-1) (PR). These values do not differ significantly between males and 
females. Contrast water immersion is a valid method of hastening plasma lactate 
decrease during recovery after intense anaerobic exercise for both males and 
females. An approximately 1.8 mmol L(-1) difference between the two conditions 
may be expected after 30 min. With differences among elite competitors as little 
as 1-2%, this reduction may be of practical significance.

The purpose was to assess whether body cooling between 2 bouts of exercise in 
the heat enhances performance during the second exercise session. Using a 
random, crossover design, 15 subjects (3 women, 12 men; 28 +/- 2 years, 180 +/- 
2 cm, 69 +/- 2.3 kg) participated in all 3 trials. Subjects ran 90 minutes on 
hilly trails in a hot environment (approximately 27 degrees C) before 12 minutes 
of either cold water immersion (CWI; 13.98 degrees C), ice water immersion (IWI; 
5.23 degrees C), or a mock treatment (MT) of sitting in a tub with no water 
(29.50 degrees C). After immersion, subjects ran a 2-mile race. CWI had faster 
(p < 0.05) performance time (725 seconds) than MT (769 seconds). CWI and IWI had 
significantly (p < 0.05) lower rectal temperatures postimmersion than MT as well 
as postrace (p < 0.05). Heart rate also remained significantly lower (p < 0.05) 
during the CWI and IWI trials for the first half of the race. In conclusion, CWI 
enhances performance (6% improvement in race time) in the second bout of 
exercise, supporting its potential role as an ergogenic aid in athletic 
performance.

We used three techniques of precooling to test the hypothesis that heat strain 
would be alleviated, muscle temperature (Tmu) would be reduced, and as a result 
there would be delayed decrements in peak power output (PPO) during exercise in 
hot, humid conditions. Twelve male team-sport players completed four cycling 
intermittent sprint protocols (CISP). Each CISP consisted of twenty 2-min 
periods, each including 10 s of passive rest, 5 s of maximal sprint against a 
resistance of 7.5% body mass, and 105 s of active recovery. The CISP, preceded 
by 20 min of no cooling (Control), precooling via an ice vest (Vest), cold water 
immersion (Water), and ice packs covering the upper legs (Packs), was performed 
in hot, humid conditions (mean +/- SE; 33.7 +/- 0.3 degrees C, 51.6 +/- 2.2% 
relative humidity) in a randomized order. The rate of heat strain increase 
during the CISP was faster in Control than Water and Packs (P < 0.01), but it 
was similar to Vest. Packs and Water blunted the rise of Tmu until minute 16 and 
for the duration of the CISP (40 min), respectively (P < 0.01). Reductions in 
PPO occurred from minute 32 onward in Control, and an increase in PPO by 
approximately 4% due to Packs was observed (main effect; P < 0.05). The method 
of precooling determined the extent to which heat strain was reduced during 
intermittent sprint cycling, with leg precooling offering the greater ergogenic 
effect on PPO than either upper body or whole body cooling.

Effects of cold and hot water immersion on the mechanical properties of human 
muscle and tendon in vivo.

BACKGROUND: Cooling and heating have been shown to affect the contractile 
properties of muscles. However, the reasons for these changes remain unclear. 
The present study aimed to quantify the mechanical properties of muscle and 
tendon during passive stretch and active contraction, and to investigate the 
effects of cooling and heating on the mechanical properties of muscle and 
tendon.
METHODS: Before and after these conditions, the elongation of the muscle 
fascicle, tendon and aponeurosis of the medial gastrocnemius muscle was directly 
measured by ultrasonography, while the ankle joint was passively moved within 
the joint range of +15 to -30 deg (0 deg = neutral anatomic position; positive 
values for plantar flexion) and subjects performed ramp isometric plantar 
flexion up to the voluntary maximum.
FINDINGS: While the muscle fascicle, tendon and aponeurosis stretched during 
passive dorsi-flexion, the elongation of the tendon was significantly greater 
than that of the aponeurosis. During isometric contraction, the maximal 
elongation of the tendon was significantly greater than that of the aponeurosis. 
After cooling and heating, no significant changes in the elongation of muscle 
fascicle, tendon and aponeurosis were found during passive stretch. Similarly, 
after both the immersions there were no changes in the relationship between the 
estimated muscle force and elongation of each structure (tendon-aponeurosis 
complex, tendon) during isometric contraction.
INTERPRETATION: These results implied that the general application of icing and 
hot pack did not change the mechanical properties of muscle and tendon.

INTRODUCTION: We examined the effect of prior heating, by exercise and 
warm-water immersion, on core cooling rates in individuals rendered mildly 
hypothermic by immersion in cold water.
METHODS: There were seven male subjects who were randomly assigned to one of 
three groups: 1) seated rest for 15 min (control); 2) cycling ergometry for 15 
min at 70% Vo2 peak (active warming); or 3) immersion in a circulated bath at 40 
degrees C to an esophageal temperature (Tes) similar to that at the end of 
exercise (passive warming). Subjects were then immersed in 7 degrees C water to 
a Tes of 34.5 degrees C.
RESULTS: Initial Tes cooling rates (initial approximately 6 min cooling) 
differed significantly among the treatment conditions (0.074 +/- 0.045, 0.129 
+/- 0.076, and 0.348 +/- 0.117 degrees C x min(-1) for control, active, and 
passive warming conditions, respectively); however, secondary cooling rates 
(rates following initial approximately 6 min cooling to the end of immersion) 
were not different between treatments (average of 0.102 +/- 0.085 degrees C x 
min(-1)). Overall Tes cooling rates during the full immersion period differed 
significantly and were 0.067 +/- 0.047, 0.085 +/- 0.045, and 0.209 +/- 0.131 
degrees C x min(-1) for control, active, and passive warming, respectively.
DISCUSSION: These results suggest that prior warming by both active and, to a 
greater extent, passive warming, may predispose a person to greater heat loss 
and to experience a larger decline in core temperature when subsequently exposed 
to cold water. Thus, functional time and possibly survival time could be reduced 
when cold water immersion is preceded by whole-body passive warming, and to a 
lesser degree by active warming.

We investigated the effects of brief leg cooling after moderate exercise on the 
cardiorespiratory responses to subsequent exercise in the heat. Following 40 min 
of ergometer cycling [65% peak oxygen uptake (VO(2peak))] at 35 degrees C (Ex. 
1), seven male subjects [21.9 (1.1) years of age; 170.9 (1.9) cm height; 66.0 
(2.0) kg body mass; 46.7 (2.0) ml kg(-1) min(-1) VO(2peak)] immersed their legs 
in 35 degrees C (control condition, CONT) or 20 degrees C (cooling condition, 
COOL) water for 5 min and then repeated the cycling (as before, but for 10 min) 
(Ex. 2). Just before Ex. 2, esophageal temperature ( T(es)) was lower in COOL 
than in CONT [36.9 (0.2) vs 37.5 (0.1) degrees C] ( P<0.01), as also were both 
mean skin temperature [33.9 (0.2) vs 35.2 (0.2) degrees C] ( P<0.01), and heart 
rate (HR) [93.2 (6.0) vs 102.7 (4.9) beats min(-1)] ( P<0.05). During Ex. 2, no 
differences between CONT and COOL were observed in oxygen uptake, arterial blood 
pressure, blood lactate concentration, or ratings of perceived exertion; 
however, T(es), skin temperature, and HR were lower in COOL than in CONT. 
Further, during the first 5 min of Ex. 2, minute ventilation was significantly 
lower in COOL than in CONT [50.3 (2.0) vs 53.4 (2.6) l min(-1)] ( P<0.01). These 
results suggest that brief leg cooling during the recovery period may be 
effective at reducing thermal and cardiorespiratory strain during subsequent 
exercise in the heat.

changes in physiological variables.

The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of three different 
recovery modalities--active (ACT), passive (PAS) and contrast temperature water 
immersion (CTW)--on the performance of repeated treadmill running, lactate 
concentration and pH. Fourteen males performed two pairs of treadmill runs to 
exhaustion at 120% and 90% of peak running speed (PRS) over a 4-hour period. 
ACT, PAS or CTW was performed for 15-min after the first pair of treadmill runs. 
ACT consisted of running at 40% PRS, PAS consisted of standing stationary and 
CTW consisted of alternating between 60-s cold (10 degrees C) and 120-s hot (42 
degrees C) water immersion. Run times were converted to time to cover set 
distance using critical power. Type of recovery modality did not have a 
significant effect on change in time to cover 400 m (Mean +/- SD; ACT 2.7 +/- 
3.6 s, PAS 2.9 +/- 4.2 s, CTW 4.2 +/- 6.9 s), 1000 m (ACT 2.2 +/- 4.0 s, PAS 4.8 
+/- 8.6 s, CTW 2.1 +/- 7.2 s) or 5000 m (ACT 1.4 +/- 29.0 s, PAS 16.7 +/- 58.5 
s, CTW 11.7 +/- 33.0 s). Post exercise blood lactate concentration was lower in 
ACT and CTW compared with PAS. Participants reported an increased perception of 
recovery in the CTW compared with ACT and PAS. Blood pH was not significantly 
influenced by recovery modality. Data suggest both ACT and CTW reduce lactate 
accumulation after high intensity running, but high intensity treadmill running 
performance is returned to baseline 4-hours after the initial exercise bout 
regardless of the recovery strategy employed.

To investigate the possibility that environmental temperature may exert 
physiologically significant direct, local effects on subcutaneous adipose tissue 
temperatures, and its secretion of leptin, we exposed healthy males ( n=12) to 
repeated cold-water immersion (study 1), and also incubated surgically removed 
human subcutaneous adipose tissue samples ( n=7) at 27 degrees, 32 degrees and 
37 degrees C (study 2). In vivo immersions were conducted over 15 days (60-90 
min at 18 degrees C). Regional body temperatures and plasma leptin 
concentrations were measured before and during immersion. Acute cold exposure 
suppressed plasma leptin concentration (25 min: -14%, 60 min: -22%, P=0.0001), 
whilst repeated cold-water immersion was associated with an increase of plasma 
leptin concentration relative to test day 1 (+19% day 8, +13% day 15, overall 
P=0.03). Leptin secretion in vitro decreased 3.7-fold as the incubation 
temperature decreased from 37 degrees to 27 degrees C ( P=0.001). In a 
compartmental model of leptin turnover in vivo, the measured (local) temperature 
effect on leptin secretion in vitro was more than able to account for the 
observed cold-induced decrease in leptin concentration in vivo. We therefore 
conclude that acute and repeated cold-water immersions have separate and 
opposing effects on circulating leptin concentrations in humans. Under our 
experimental conditions, the local effects of reduced subcutaneous adipose 
tissue temperature may be a more important contributor to the acute effects 
observed in vivo, than the sympathetically mediated suppression of leptin 
secretion.

We investigated the impact of cold-water acclimation on whole-body fluid 
regulation using tracer-dilution methods to differentiate between the 
intracellular and extracellular fluid compartments. Seven euhydrated males [age 
24.7 (8.7) years, mass 74.4 (6.4) kg, height 176.8 (7.8) cm, sum of eight 
skinfolds 107.4 (20.4) mm; mean (SD)] participated in a 14-day cold-water 
acclimation protocol, with 60-min resting cold-water stress tests [CWST; 18.1 
(0.1) degrees C] on days 1, 8 and 15, and 90-min resting cold-water immersions 
[18.4 (0.4) degrees C] on intervening days. Subjects were immersed to the 4th 
intercostal space. Intracellular and extracellular fluid compartments, and 
plasma protein, electrolyte and hormone concentrations were investigated. During 
the first CWST, the intracellular fluid (5.5%) and plasma volumes were reduced 
(6.1%), while the interstitial fluid volume was simultaneously expanded (5.4%). 
This pattern was replicated on days 8 and 15, but did not differ significantly 
among test days. Acclimation did not produce significant changes in the 
pre-immersion distribution of total body water, or changes in plasma osmolality, 
total protein, electrolyte, atrial natriuretic peptide or aldosterone 
concentrations. Furthermore, a 14-day cold-water acclimation regimen did not 
elicit significant changes in body-fluid distribution, urine production, or the 
concentrations of plasma protein, electrolytes or the fluid-regulatory hormones. 
While acclimation trends were not evident, we have confirmed that fluid from 
extravascular cells is displaced into the interstitium during acute cold-water 
immersion, both before and after cold acclimation.

BACKGROUND: Following accidental immersion in cold water, the chance of survival 
through the initial short-term period may depend on manual dexterity for 
survival tasks. We aimed to study the time course of impairment of manual 
dexterity during the initial stages of immersion.
METHODS: We investigated gross (manipulating harness buckles) and fine (Purdue 
Pegboard Assembly) manual dexterity of 11 male and 15 female subjects with 
either no immersion (Control) or after immersion of right and left hand and 
forearm in 10 degrees C water for 30, 120, and 300 s. Exposure lengths were 
presented in a counter-balanced order in a single session.
RESULTS: Mean local skin temperature decreased significantly with cold-water 
immersion, with the amount of cooling proportional to the length of exposure. 
Buckle test times increased significantly from 9.1 +/- 3.0 s during Control to 
similar values of 19.5 +/- 11.1 s and 18.14 +/- 12.1 s after 120 and 300 s of 
immersion. Pegboard scores were significantly lower at 40.2 +/- 7.6 pieces 
following 300 s of immersion compared with Control and 30 s values of 49.0 +/- 
6.4 and 47.2 +/- 6.9 pieces, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that fine and gross manual dexterity were rapidly 
and progressively impaired with short-term cold-water immersion. Therefore, 
efforts must be made to protect the hands/forearms from cold and to ensure 
survival equipment manipulation requires as little dexterity as possible.

Heat balance precedes stabilization of body temperatures during cold water 
immersion.

Certain previous studies suggest, as hypothesized herein, that heat balance 
(i.e., when heat loss is matched by heat production) is attained before 
stabilization of body temperatures during cold exposure. This phenomenon is 
explained through a theoretical analysis of heat distribution in the body 
applied to an experiment involving cold water immersion. Six healthy and fit men 
(mean +/- SD of age = 37.5 +/- 6.5 yr, height = 1.79 +/- 0.07 m, mass = 81.8 +/- 
9.5 kg, body fat = 17.3 +/- 4.2%, maximal O2 uptake = 46.9 +/- 5.5 l/min) were 
immersed in water ranging from 16.4 to 24.1 degrees C for up to 10 h. Core 
temperature (Tco) underwent an insignificant transient rise during the first 
hour of immersion, then declined steadily for several hours, although no 
subject's Tco reached 35 degrees C. Despite the continued decrease in Tco, 
shivering had reached a steady state of approximately 2 x resting metabolism. 
Heat debt peaked at 932 +/- 334 kJ after 2 h of immersion, indicating the 
attainment of heat balance, but unexpectedly proceeded to decline at 
approximately 48 kJ/h, indicating a recovery of mean body temperature. These 
observations were rationalized by introducing a third compartment of the body, 
comprising fat, connective tissue, muscle, and bone, between the core (viscera 
and vessels) and skin. Temperature change in this ""mid region"" can account for 
the incongruity between the body's heat debt and the changes in only the core 
and skin temperatures. The mid region temperature decreased by 3.7 +/- 1.1 
degrees C at maximal heat debt and increased slowly thereafter. The reversal in 
heat debt might help explain why shivering drive failed to respond to a 
continued decrease in Tco, as shivering drive might be modulated by changes in 
body heat content.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the separate effects of cooling 
during the acute (within 60 min post-exercise) or subacute (24-168 h 
post-exercise) phase on skeletal muscle after exercise. Twenty-eight male 
subjects [mean (SD) 23.8 (1.8) years] were randomly assigned to the control 
(COTG, n=10), cold-water immersion (CWIG, n=9), and double-cold-water immersion 
groups (DCWIG, n=9). The cold-water immersion (15 min) was administered to the 
subjects' legs after calf-raise exercise (CWIG: after recording initial 
post-exercise measures, DCWIG: after recording initial and 24 h post-exercise 
measures). Magnetic resonance T2-weighted images were obtained to calculate the 
T2 relaxation time (T2) of the triceps surae muscle before, immediately after, 
and at the following times post-exercise: 20, 40, and 60 min, and 24, 48, 96 and 
168 h. In addition, the ankle joint range of motion, serum creatine kinase and 
lactate dehydrogenase, and muscle soreness level were investigated before and 
after exercise. In all groups, significant T2 elevations in the gastrocnemius 
muscle appeared from immediately after to 60 min after exercise (P<0.05). 
Thereafter, COTG showed significantly re-elevated T2 levels in the gastrocnemius 
at 96-168 h post-exercise (P<0.05), while CWIG and DCWIG showed significantly 
smaller T2 values than the COTG at 96 h post-exercise (P<0.05). In addition,

significant) and significantly greater muscle soreness levels at 48 h

Cooling of hand and forearm muscles by immersion in 15 degrees C cold water for 
5 minutes improved the writing performance of patients with writer's cramp. 
Since abnormal processing of muscle spindle afferent discharges contributes to 
the pathology of writer's cramp, this effect might result from a reduction in 
muscle spindle activity by lowering muscle temperature. Cooling is a simple, 
cheap, and safe procedure, providing temporary relief for patients with writer's 
cramp.

The purpose of this investigation was to compare the thermoregulatory, 
metabolic, and perceptual effects of lower body (LBI) and whole body (WBI) 
immersion precooling techniques during submaximal exercise. Eleven healthy men 
completed two 30-min cycling bouts at 60% of maximal O(2) uptake preceded by 
immersion to the suprailiac crest (LBI) or clavicle (WBI) in 20 degrees C water. 
WBI produced significantly lower rectal temperature (T(re)) during minutes 24-30 
of immersion and lower T(re), mean skin temperature, and mean body temperature 
for the first 24, 14, and 16 min of exercise, respectively. Body heat storage 
rates differed significantly for LBI and WBI during immersion and exercise, 
although no net differences were observed between conditions. For WBI, metabolic 
heat production and heart rate were significantly higher during immersion but 
not during exercise. Thermal sensation was significantly lower (felt colder) and 
thermal discomfort was significantly higher (less comfortable) for WBI during 
immersion and exercise. In conclusion, WBI and LBI attenuated T(re) increases 
during submaximal exercise and produced similar net heat storage over the 
protocol. LBI minimized metabolic increases and negative perceptual effects 
associated with WBI.

Effect of temperature on post-tetanic potentiation in human dorsiflexor muscles.

The effect of temperature on post-tetanic potentiation (PTP) has been examined 
in the muscles of small mammals but not in human skeletal muscle. We examined 
PTP in the ankle dorsiflexor muscles of 10 young men by evoking twitches before 
and after a 7-second tetanus at 100 Hz in a control (room air approximately 21 
degrees C) condition and after immersion of the lower leg in warm (45 degrees C) 
and cold (10 degrees C) water baths for 30 min. Exposure to cold decreased 
tetanus and pre-tetanus twitch peak torque, but increased rise time, 
half-relaxation time, and muscle action potential (M-wave) amplitude; exposure 
to warm water had little effect. PTP was smallest in cold exposure 5 s 
post-tetanus, but persisted throughout the 12 min test period, whereas PTP had 
subsided by 6 min post-tetanus in control and warm exposures. M-wave amplitude 
initially decreased after exposure to warm water, recovered, then decreased 
again by 11 min post-tetanus. In contrast, exposure to cold had no initial 
effect but did increase the M-wave amplitude during the last half of the 12 min 
test period, similar to that seen in the control. The greatest immediate 
decrease in rise time and half-relaxation time was observed in the control; 
however, by 12 min post-tetanus warm exposure showed the greatest increase in 
rise time and half-relaxation time above pre-tetanus values. The decrease in the 
unpotentiated twitch torque with cooling in human dorsiflexors is typical for 
muscles with a predominance of type I (slow) fibres. The effect of cold on PTP 
is similar to that seen previously in mammalian muscles with a predominance of 
type II (fast) fibres, although the underlying mechanism of the cooling effect 
appears to differ.

84112, USA.

Many individuals with MS experience heat sensitivity that may be associated with 
transient increases in the frequency of clinical signs and symptoms. Although 
physical activity may be beneficial for those with MS, induced thermal loads may 
preclude participation in exercise and other daily activities. This project was 
designed to evaluate the effects of precooling on physical function. Six 
thermosensitive MS patients were studied. Participants performed a graded 
exercise test to determine maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) on a combined arm-leg 
ergometer. Thermal load was induced by 30 min of exercise under noncooled and 
precooled conditions at a workrate corresponding to 60% VO2max. Precooling 
consisted of 30 min lower body immersion in 16 - 17 degrees C water. Fatigue and 
25-ft walk performance were assessed before, immediately after, and 30 min 
following exercise. No treatment differences in VO2 were observed. Rectal 
temperature, heart rate, and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were 
significantly lower during the precooled exercise trial compared to the 
noncooled trial. Immediately following exercise, 25-ft walk performance and 
fatigue scores showed significantly greater deterioration in the noncooled 
condition. Precooling was effective in preventing gains in core temperature with 
physical work and may allow heat-sensitive individuals with MS to exercise with 
greater physical comfort.

Thermoregulation in control subjects and cold-adapted winter swimmers was 
examined during 1 h of cold water immersion (13 C). It was found that the 
thermoregulatory functions of winter swimmers differ from those of 
non-cold-adapted subjects. As evident from the relationship between rectal 
temperature and the magnitude of cold thermogenesis, in controls a significant 
part of cold thermogenesis during the early phase of cooling was induced by 
changes in peripheral temperature input, while in the late phase of cooling it 
was the central temperature input which was mainly engaged in induction of cold 
thermogenesis. In winter swimmers the magnitude of cold thermogenesis was solely 
related to changes in rectal temperature, indicating the predominance of the 
central temperature input in activation of heat production mechanisms. The 
thermoregulatory threshold for induction of cold thermogenesis was lowered (by 
0.34 C), but the apparent hypothalamic thermosensitivity was the same as in 
non-cold-adapted subjects. These differences are indicative of adaptation of 
thermoregulatory control centres. Additionally, the activity of thermoregulatory 
effectors was also changed. Shivering was induced later during cooling (after 40 
min) in winter swimmers than in controls, which suggests an important 
participation of non-shivering thermogenesis in the early thermogenic response. 
Winter swimmers also showed bradycardia and a greater reduction in plasma volume 
during cooling. The data indirectly indicate restriction of heat loss from the 
body. Only a non-significant increase in quantity of subcutaneous fat was 
observed in winter swimmers. Thus, winter swimmers were able to survive a 
significantly greater temperature gradient between body and environment than 
non-cold-adapted subjects by modifying the sensory functions of hypothalamic 
thermoregulatory centres to lower heat loss and produce less heat during cold 
exposure. Additionally, the capacity of the total cold thermogenesis due to 
potentiation of non-shivering heat production was also increased. Heat produced 
due to thermogenic action of adrenaline may represent more than a quarter of the 
total cold thermogenesis. In conclusion, the data suggest that winter swimmers 
exhibit metabolic, hypothermic and insulative types of cold adaptation.

University, Prague, Czech Republic.

To differentiate between the effect of cold and hydrostatic pressure on hormone 
and cardiovascular functions of man, a group of young men was examined during 
1-h head-out immersions in water of different temperatures (32 degrees C, 20 
degrees C and 14 degrees C). Immersion in water at 32 degrees C did not change 
rectal temperature and metabolic rate, but lowered heart rate (by 15%) and 
systolic and diastolic blood pressures (by 11 %, or 12%, respectively), compared 
to controls at ambient air temperature. Plasma renin activity, plasma cortisol 
and aldosterone concentrations were also lowered (by 46%, 34%, and 17%, 
respectively), while diuresis was increased by 107%. Immersion at 20 degrees C 
induced a similar decrease in plasma renin activity, heart rate and systolic and 
diastolic blood pressures as immersion at thermoneutrality, in spite of lowered 
rectal temperature and an increased metabolic rate by 93%. Plasma cortisol 
concentrations tended to decrease, while plasma aldosterone concentration was 
unchanged. Diuresis was increased by 89%. No significant differences in changes 
in diuresis, plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration compared to 
subjects immersed to 32 degrees C were observed. Cold water immersion (14 
degrees C) lowered rectal temperature and increased metabolic rate (by 350%), 
heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (by 5%, 7%, and 8%, 
respectively). Plasma noradrenaline and dopamine concentrations were increased 
by 530% and by 250% respectively, while diuresis increased by 163% (more than at 
32 degrees C). Plasma aldosterone concentrations increased by 23%. Plasma renin 
activity was reduced as during immersion in water at the highest temperature. 
Cortisol concentrations tended to decrease. Plasma adrenaline concentrations 
remained unchanged. Changes in plasma renin activity were not related to changes 
in aldosterone concentrations. Immersion in water of different temperatures did 
not increase blood concentrations of cortisol. There was no correlation between 
changes in rectal temperature and changes in hormone production. Our data 
supported the hypothesis that physiological changes induced by water immersion 
are mediated by humoral control mechanisms, while responses induced by cold are 
mainly due to increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system.

Epidemiological studies have shown an increase in acute myocardial infarctions 
or deaths due to myocardial infarction in colder weather; the mechanisms most 
likely involve increased blood levels of haemostatic risk factors, and increases 
in arterial blood pressure and heart rate. We studied the relationship between 
cold adaptation, haemostatic risk factors and haemodynamic variables. Cold 
adaptation was obtained by a programme of immersion of the whole body up to the 
neck in a water-filled bath, the temperature of which was gradually decreased 
from 22 degrees C to 14 degrees C, time of exposure being increased from 5 to 20 
min over a period of 90 days. We studied 428 patients (44% men) and measured 
blood levels of fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), tissue 
plasminogen activator antigen (t-PA), plasma viscosity, von Willebrand factor, 
D-dimer and platelet count, both at baseline and after 90 days of daily 
immersion. There were significant reductions in von Willebrand factor (-3%; p < 
0.001), and plasma viscosity (-3.0 s; p < 0.001), and a mild but significant 
increase in PAI-1 (+0.3 IU/ml; p = 0.02). The pressure rate product (systolic 
blood pressure x heart rate) was also significantly lower after cold adaptation 
(-310; p = 0.004). Cold adaptation, compared with exposure to cold weather, 
induces different haemodynamic responses and changes of blood levels of 
haemostatic risk factors.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of precooling skin and core temperature on a 
70 second cycling power test performed in a warm and humid environment (29 
degrees C, 80% relative humidity).
METHODS: Thirteen male national and international level representative cyclists 
(mean (SD) age 24.1 (4.1) years; height 181.5 (6.2) cm; weight 75.5 (6.4) kg; 
maximal oxygen uptake (VO2peak) 66.1 (7.0) ml/kg/min) were tested in random 
order after either 30 minutes of precooling using cold water immersion or under 
control conditions (no precooling). Tests were separated by a minimum of two 
days. The protocol consisted of a 10 minute warm up at 60% of VO2peak followed 
by three minutes of stretching. This was immediately followed by the 70 second 
power test which was performed on a standard road bicycle equipped with 172.5 mm 
powermeter cranks and mounted on a stationary ergometer.
RESULTS: Mean power output for the 70 second performance test after precooling 
was significantly (p<0.005) increased by 3.3 (2.7)% from 581 (57) W to 603 (60) 
W. Precooling also significantly (p<0.05) decreased core, mean body, and upper 
and lower body skin temperature; however, by the start of the performance test, 
lower body skin temperature was no different from control. After precooling, 
heart rate was also significantly lower than control throughout the warm up 
(p<0.05). Ratings of perceived exertion were significantly higher than the 
control condition at the start of the warm up after precooling, but lower than 
the control condition by the end of the warm up (p<0.05). No differences in 
blood lactate concentration were detected between conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: Precooling improves short term cycling performance, possibly by 
initiating skin vasoconstriction which may increase blood availability to the 
working muscles. Future research is required to determine the physiological 
basis for the ergogenic effects of precooling on high intensity exercise.

This study examined the immunological responses to cold exposure together with 
the effects of pretreatment with either passive heating or exercise (with and 
without a thermal clamp). On four separate occasions, seven healthy men [mean 
age 24.0 +/- 1.9 (SE) yr, peak oxygen consumption = 45.7 +/- 2.0 ml. kg(-1). 
min(-1)] sat for 2 h in a climatic chamber maintained at 5 degrees C. Before 
exposure, subjects participated in one of four pretreatment conditions. For the 
thermoneutral control condition, subjects remained seated for 1 h in a water 
bath at 35 degrees C. In another pretreatment, subjects were passively heated in 
a warm (38 degrees C) water bath for 1 h. In two other pretreatments, subjects 
exercised for 1 h at 55% peak oxygen consumption (once immersed in 18 degrees C 
water and once in 35 degrees C water). Core temperature rose by 1 degrees C 
during passive heating and during exercise in 35 degrees C water and remained 
stable during exercise in 18 degrees C water (thermal clamping). Subsequent cold 
exposure induced a leukocytosis and granulocytosis, an increase in natural 
killer cell count and activity, and a rise in circulating levels of 
interleukin-6. Pretreatment with exercise in 18 degrees C water augmented the 
leukocyte, granulocyte, and monocyte response. These results indicate that acute 
cold exposure has immunostimulating effects and that, with thermal clamping, 
pretreatment with physical exercise can enhance this response. Increases in 
levels of circulating norepinephrine may account for the changes observed during 
cold exposure and their modification by changes in initial status.

Cryotherapy is an effective treatment for acute sports injury to soft tissue, 
although the effect of cryotherapy on exercise-induced muscle damage is unclear. 
The aim of this study was to assess the effects of cold water immersion on the 
symptoms of exercise-induced muscle damage following strenuous eccentric 
exercise. After performing a bout of damage-inducing eccentric exercise (eight 
sets of five maximal reciprocal contractions at 0.58 rad x s(-1)) of the elbow 
flexors on an isokinetic dynamometer, 15 females aged 22.0+/-2.0 years (mean +/- 
s) were allocated to a control group (no treatment, n = 7) or a cryotherapy 
group (n = 8). Subjects in the cryotherapy group immersed their exercised arm in 
cold water (15 degrees C) for 15 min immediately after eccentric exercise and 
then every 12 h for 15 min for a total of seven sessions. Muscle tenderness, 
plasma creatine kinase activity, relaxed elbow angle, isometric strength and 
swelling (upper arm circumference) were measured immediately before and for 3 
days after eccentric exercise. Analysis of variance revealed significant (P < 
0.05) main effects for time for all variables, with increases in muscle 
tenderness, creatine kinase activity and upper arm circumference, and decreases 
in isometric strength and relaxed elbow angle. There were significant 
interactions (P<0.05) of group x time for relaxed elbow angle and creatine 
kinase activity. Relaxed elbow angle was greater and creatine kinase activity 
lower for the cryotherapy group than the controls on days 2 and 3 following the 
eccentric exercise. We conclude that although cold water immersion may reduce 
muscle stiffness and the amount of post-exercise damage after strenuous 
eccentric activity, there appears to be no effect on the perception of 
tenderness and strength loss, which is characteristic after this form of 
activity.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a decreased body 
core temperature before a simulated portion of a triathlon (swim,15 min; bike, 
45 min) and examine whether precooling could attenuate thermal strain and 
increase subjective exercise tolerance in a warm environment (26.6 degrees C/60% 
relative humidity (rh)).
METHODS: Six endurance trained triathletes (28+/-2 yr, 8.2+/-1.7% body fat) 
completed two randomly assigned trials 1 wk apart. The precooling trial (PC) 
involved lowering body core temperature (-0.5 degrees C rectal temperature, Tre) 
in water before swimming. The control trial (CON) was identical except no 
precooling was performed. Water temperature and environmental conditions were 
maintained at 25.6 degrees C and 26.6 degrees C/60% rh, respectively, throughout 
all testing.
RESULTS: Mean time to precool was 31+/-8 min and average time to reach baseline 
Tre during cycling was 9+/-7 min. Oxygen uptake (VO2), HR, skin temperature 
(Tsk), Tre, RPE, and thermal sensation (TS) were recorded following the swim 
segment and throughout cycling. No significant differences in mean body (Tb) or 
Tsk were noted between PC and CON, but a significant difference (P < 0.05) in 
Tre between treatments was noted through the early phases of cycling. No 
significant differences were reported in HR, VO2, RPE, TS, or sweat rate (SR) 
between treatments. Body heat storage (S) was negative following swimming in 
both PC (-92+/-6 W x m2) and CON (-66+/-9 W x m2). A greater S occurred in PC 
(109+/-6 W x m2) vs CON (79+/-4 W x m2) during cycling (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Precooling attenuated the rise in Tre, but this effect was 
transient. Therefore, precooling is not recommended before a triathlon under 
similar environmental conditions.

The purpose of the study contained herein was to investigate the effects of old 
traditional physiotherapeutic treatments on cerebral autoregulation. Treatment 
consisted of complete body immersion in cold or warm water baths. Fifteen 
volunteers were investigated by means of transcranial Doppler sonography and a 
servo-controlled noninvasive device for blood pressure measuring. One group of 8 
volunteers (mean age, 27.2+/-3.5 yr; gender, 3 females/5 males) was subjected to 
cold baths of 22 degrees C for 20 min Another group of 7 volunteers (mean age, 
52.1+/-8.5 yr; gender, 4 females/3 males) took hyperthermic baths at rising 
water temperatures from 36 degrees to 42 degrees C, increased by 1 degree C 
every 5 min. Each volunteer in both groups underwent autoregulation tests two to 
four times before, during, and after the thermic bath. Dynamic autoregulation 
was measured by the response of cerebral blood flow velocity to a transient 
decrease of the mean arterial blood pressure, induced by rapid deflation of 
thigh cuffs. The autoregulation index, i.e., a measure of the speed of change of 
cerebral autoregulation, was used to quantify the response. Further parameters 
were core temperature, blood pressure (mm Hg) and CO2et. During hypothermic 
baths, core temperature decreased by 0.3 degrees C (P = 0.001), measured between 
preliminary phase and the end of the bath; the autoregulation index decreased 
significantly (P < 0.05) from 5.3 before the bath to 4.25 during the bath. 
During hyperthermic baths, the autoregulation index increased from 6.0 to 7.5 
and 8.9 (P < 0.001), with an increase of core temperature of 0.4 degrees C. The 
main cerebral autoregulation system is dependent on changes of core temperature, 
provoked by hypothermic or hyperthermic whole-body thermostimulus. Application 
of hyperthermic baths increased the autoregulation index, and hypothermic baths 
decreased the autoregulation index. Further studies are needed to prove the 
positive effects of thermo-stimulating water applications on cerebral 
hemodynamics in patients with cerebral diseases.

1. The initial respiratory and cardiac responses to cold water immersion are 
thought to be responsible for a significant number of open water deaths each 
year. Previous research has demonstrated that the magnitude of these responses 
can be reduced by repeated immersions in cold waterwhether the site of 
habituation is central or peripheral. 2. Two groups of subjects undertook two 3 
min head-out immersions in stirred water at 10 C of the right-hand side of the 
body (R). Between these two immersions (3 whole days) the control group (n = 7) 
were not exposed to cold water, but the habituation group (n = 8) undertook a 
further six 3 min head-out immersions in stirred water at 10 C of the left-hand 
side of the body (L). 3. Repeated L immersions reduced (P < 0.01) the heart 
rate, respiratory frequency and volume responses. During the second R immersion 
a reduction (P < 0.05) in the magnitude of the responses evoked was seen in the 
habituation group but not in the control group, despite both groups having 
identical skin temperature profiles. 4. It is concluded that the mechanisms 
involved in producing habituation of the initial responses are located more 
centrally than the peripheral receptors.

immersion.

The initial responses to cold-water immersion, evoked by stimulation of 
peripheral cold receptors, include tachycardia, a reflex inspiratory gasp and 
uncontrollable hyperventilation. When immersed naked, the maximum responses are 
initiated in water at 10 degrees C, with smaller responses being observed 
following immersion in water at 15 degrees C. Habituation of the initial 
responses can be achieved following repeated immersions, but the specificity of 
this response with regard to water temperature is not known. Thirteen healthy 
male volunteers were divided into a control (C) group (n = 5) and a habituation 
(H) group (n = 8). Each subject undertook two 3-min head-out immersions in water 
at 10 degrees C wearing swimming trunks. These immersions took place at a 
corresponding time of day with 4 days separating the two immersions. In the 
intervening period the C group were not exposed to cold water, while the H group 
undertook another six, 3-min, head-out immersions in water at 15 degrees C. 
Respiratory rate (fR), inspiratory minute volume (VI) and heart rate (fH) were 
measured continuously throughout each immersion. Following repeated immersions 
in water at 15 degrees C, the fR, VI and fH responses of the H group over the 
first 30 s of immersion were reduced (P < 0.01) from 33.3 breaths x min(-1), 
50.5 l x min(-1) and 114 beats x min(-1) respectively, to 19.8 breaths x min(-1) 
26.41 x min(-1) and 98 beats x min(-1), respectively. In water at 10 degrees C 
these responses were reduced (P < 0.01) from 47.3 breaths x min(-1), 67.61 x 
min(-1) and 128 beats x min(-1) to 24.0 breaths x min(-1), 29.5 l x min(-1) and 
109 beats x min(-1), respectively over a corresponding period of immersion. 
Similar reductions were observed during the last 2.5 min of immersions. The 
initial responses of the C group were unchanged. It is concluded that 
habituation of the cold shock response can be achieved by immersion in warmer 
water than that for which protection is required. This suggests that repeated 
submaximal stimulation of the cutaneous cold receptors is sufficient to 
attenuate the responses to more maximal stimulation.

This study examined whether serial cold-water immersions over a 10-h period 
would lead to fatigue of shivering and vasoconstriction. Eight men were immersed 
(2 h) in 20 degrees C water three times (0700, 1100, and 1500) in 1 day 
(Repeat). This trial was compared with single immersions (Control) conducted at 
the same times of day. Before Repeat exposures at 1100 and 1500, rewarming was 
employed to standardize initial rectal temperature. The following observations 
were made in the Repeat relative to the Control trial: 1) rectal temperature was 
lower and heat debt was higher (P < 0.05) at 1100; 2) metabolic heat production 
was lower (P < 0.05) at 1100 and 1500; 3) subjects perceived the Repeat trial as 
warmer at 1100. These data suggest that repeated cold exposures may impair the 
ability to maintain normal body temperature because of a blunting of metabolic 
heat production, perhaps reflecting a fatigue mechanism. An alternative 
explanation is that shivering habituation develops rapidly during serially 
repeated cold exposures.

Shivering thermogenesis may enable individuals to maintain rectal temperature 
during acute cold exposure. This data analysis revisited this hypothesis and 
compared previously published data with unpublished data from our laboratory on 
those subjects that were terminated from cold water immersion early because of a 
reduction in rectal temperature (T(re)) - 35 degrees C. T(re), mean skin 
temperature (T(sk)), and oxygen uptake (VO2) were recorded at 5, 30, 60, and 90 
min of immersion and were used to calculate 3delta readings for each exposure, 
that is, deltaT(30) minus T5, T60 minus T(30), and T(90) minus T(60). Single 
group t-tests were used to examine differences in deltaT(re), deltaT(sk), and 
deltaVO2 between the published data (PD) group and the individual subjects who 
were terminated early (TE) at each of three water temperatures (18 degrees C, 22 
degrees C, 26 degrees C). For deltaVO2 the TE subjects were dichotomized by 
fatness (low percent fat, 8%-12%; or high percent fat, 18%-22%) to account for 
the VO2 differences between these groups (i.e., fatness) during cold water 
immersion. deltaT(re) was significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in TE subjects 
compared with PD subjects at all timepoints for 18 degrees C and 26 degrees C. 
At 22 degrees C, the TE subject exhibited a significantly greater (p < 0.05) 
decrease in deltaT(re) than the PD group at 90 min of immersion only. No 
significant (p > 0.05) differences in deltaT(sk) between the PD and TE groups 
were detected for any of the exposure temperatures over all time points. No 
difference (p > 0.05) between PD subjects and TE subjects for deltaVO2 was 
exhibited at any time point at any temperature. It appears that with respect to 
the TE group, elevations in VO2 were comparable to the PD group, but the TE 
group was unable to maintain T(re) during cold water immersion. In conclusion, 
from these data it appears that shivering thermogenesis does in part enhance the 
individual's ability to maintain T(re); however, as evidenced in the TE group, 
it also appears that the alterations in shivering thermogenesis for certain 
individuals may not be great enough to offset heat loss.

The purpose of this study was to monitor changes in body and skin temperatures, 
heat production, subjective shivering, cold sensation and body fat content in 
humans after intermittent cold water immersion. Repeated exposures of young 
sportsmen to cold water (head out, 14 degrees C, 1 h, 3 times per week for 4-6 
weeks) induced changes in regulation of thermal homeostasis. ""Cold acclimated"" 
subjects exhibited an hypothermic type of adaptation. Central and peripheral 
body temperatures at rest and during cold immersion were lowered. The metabolic 
response to cold was delayed and subjective shivering was attenuated. The 
observed hypothermia was due to the shift of the threshold for induction of cold 
thermogenesis to lower body temperatures. ""Cold acclimated"" subjects also showed 
a lowered cold sensation. Because of the observed physiological changes, about 
20% of the total heat production was saved during one cold water immersion of 
""cold acclimated"" subjects. Maximal aerobic and anaerobic performances were not 
altered. No change in the thermosensitivity of the body temperature controller, 
as assessed from the unchanged slope of the relation between the deep body 
temperature and total heat production, was observed. Changes in cold sensation 
and regulation of cold thermogenesis were noticed first after four cold water 
immersions and persisted for at least 2 weeks after termination of the 
adaptation procedure. A trend towards a small increase in the body fat content 
was also observed. This finding, as well as the increased vasoconstriction, 
evidenced by the lowered skin temperature, indicate that slight changes in body 
insulation may also occur after ""cold acclimation"" in humans.

Eucapnic hypoxia lowers human cold thermoregulatory response thresholds and 
accelerates core cooling.

Hypoxia lowers the basic thermoregulatory responses of animals and humans. In 
cold-exposed animals, hypoxia increases core temperature (Tco) cooling rate and 
suppresses shivering thermogenesis. In humans, the experimental effects of 
hypoxia on thermoregulation are equivocal. Also, the effect of hypoxia has not 
been separated from that of hypocapnia consequent to hypoxic hyperventilation. 
To determine the isolated effects of hypoxia on warm and cold thermoregulatory 
responses and core cooling during mild cold stress, we examined the Tco 
thresholds for sweating, vasoconstriction, and shivering as well as the core 
cooling rates of eight subjects immersed in 28 degrees C water under eucapnic 
conditions. On 2 separate days, subjects exercised on an underwater cycle 
ergometer to elevate Tco above the sweating threshold. They then rested and 
cooled until they shivered vigorously. Subjects inspired humidified room air 
during the control trial. For the eucapnic hypoxia trial, they inspired 12% 
O2-balance N2 with CO2 added to maintain eucapnia. Eucapnic hypoxia lowered the 
Tco thresholds for vasoconstriction and shivering by 0.14 and 0.19 degrees C, 
respectively, and increased core cooling rate by 33% (1.83 vs. 1.38 degrees 
C/h). These results demonstrate that eucapnic hypoxia enhances the core cooling 
rate in humans during mild cold stress. This may be attributed in part to a 
delay in the onset of vasoconstriction and shivering as well as increased 
respiratory heat loss during hypoxic hyperventilation.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether or not repeated short-term 
cold water immersions can induce a change in the activity of the sympathetic 
nervous system and, consequently, in cardiovascular functions in healthy young 
athletes. Changes in some plasma hormone concentrations were also followed. A 
single cold water immersion (head-out, at 14 degrees C, for 1 h) increased 
sympathetic nervous system activity, as evidenced by a four-fold increase (P < 
0.05) in plasma noradrenaline concentration. Plasma adrenaline and dopamine 
concentrations were not increased significantly. Plasma renin-angiotensin 
activity was reduced by half (P < 0.05) during immersion but plasma aldosterone 
concentration was unchanged. Stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system 
during immersion did not induce significant changes in heart rate, but induced 
peripheral vasoconstriction (as judged from a decrease in skin temperature) and 
a small increase (by 10%) in systolic and diastolic blood pressures. No clear 
change in reactivity of the sympathetic nervous system was observed due to 
repeated cold water immersions (three times a week, for 6 weeks). Neither the 
plasma renin-angiotensin activity, aldosterone concentration nor cardiovascular 
parameters were significantly influenced by repeated cold water immersions. A 
lowered diastolic pressure and an increase in peripheral vasoconstriction were 
observed after cold acclimation, however. Evidently, the repeated cold stimuli 
were not sufficient to induce significant adaptational changes in sympathetic 
activity and hormone production.

Isolated effects of peripheral arm and central body cooling on arm performance.

Giesbrecht GG(1), Wu MP, White MD, Johnston CE, Bristow GK.

Author information:
(1)Laboratory for Exercise and Environmental Medicine, University of Manitoba, 
Winnipeg, Canada.

BACKGROUND: Whole body cooling impairs manual arm performance. The independent 
contributions of local (peripheral) and/or whole body (central) cooling are not 
known. Therefore, a protocol was developed in which the arm and the rest of the 
body could be independently cooled.
METHODS: Biceps temperature (Tmus), at a depth of 20 mm, and esophageal 
temperature (Tes) were measured. Six subjects were immersed to the clavicles in 
a tank (body tank) of water under 3 conditions: 1) cold body-cold arm (CB-CA); 
2) warm body-cold arm (WB-CA); and 3) cold body-warm arm (CB-WA). In the latter 
two conditions, subjects placed their dominant arm in a separate (arm) tank. 
Water temperature (Tw) in each tank was independently controlled. In conditions 
requiring cold body and/or cold arm, Tw in the appropriate tanks was 8 degrees 
C. In conditions requiring warm body and/or warm arm, Tw in the appropriate 
tanks was adjusted between 29 and 38 degrees C to maintain body/arm temperature 
at baseline values. A battery of 6 tests, requiring fine or gross motor 
movements, were performed immediately before immersion and after 15, 45, and 70 
minutes of immersion.
RESULTS: In CB-CA, Tes decreased from an average of 37.2 to 35.6 degrees C and 
Tmus decreased from 34.6 to 22.0 degrees C. In WB-CA, Tmus decreased to 18.1 
degrees C (Tes = 37.1 degrees C), and in CB-WA, Tes decreased to 35.8 degrees C 
(Tmus = 34.5 degrees C). By the end of immersion, there were significant 
decrements (43-85%) in the performance of all tests in CB-CA and WB-CA (p < 
0.0002); scores for each test were similar in these two conditions. There was no 
significant change in scores throughout the CB-WA condition. In both conditions 
with arm cooling (i.e., WB-CA and CB-CA), Tmus accounted for 85-98% of the 
variance in all tests. When the core was cooled in the CB-WA condition, Tes was 
significantly correlated to scores in only two tests (accounted for 90 and 93% 
of the variance) although the actual effect was small. In the CB-CA condition, 
partial correlations indicated that Tes accounted for 4-10% of the variance in 
scores of 4 tests.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that cooling of the body and/or the arm elicits large 
decrements in finger, hand and arm performance. The decrements are due almost 
entirely to the local effects of arm tissue cooling.

Influence of cold water immersion on heat debt and substrate utilization in 
males varying in body composition: a retrospective analysis.

USA.

The present article is a retrospective analysis of previously published data. 
This analysis examined the effect of immersion in 18, 22 and 26 degrees C cold 
water, on heat debt (kJ), substrate utilization [i.e., R (respiratory exchange 
ratio) calculated using indirect calorimetry], and aerobic metabolic rate (i.e., 
VO2 (oxygen consumption) 1 # min(-1)] in 24 male volunteers (20-35 years) given 
a preexposure meal (60.2 g carbohydrate, 12.0 g protein, and 2.8 g fat at 60 min 
prior to the experimental trial) and examined during 90 min of immersion to the 
first thoracic vertebrae. Body composition was determined via underwater 
densitometry. Subjects were divided with respect to high body fat (HF; 18-22%, n 
= 12) or low body fat (LF; 8-12%, n = 12) and randomly assigned to one of three 
water temperatures. Body heat debt and R did not differ between the LF or HF 
groups, between temperatures, or across time. Percent calories utilized 
indicated that for these experimental conditions the predominant substrate 
utilized between the LF and HF groups across time was derived from carbohydrate. 
In addition, VO2 was greater (p = .0004) in the LF than HF group, and the latter 
was greater (p = .0013) in the 18 degrees C group versus the 26 degrees C group 
and increased across time (p = .0001); that is, VO2 after 5 min of immersion was 
less than at 60 and 90 min, and values obtained after 30 min of immersion were 
less than those at 90 min of immersion. Based on these data, it appears that the 
LF group would expend more calories (308.9 vs. 199.9 kcal, respectively) and 
more likely derive these calories from a carbohydrate source than the HF group 
during 90 min of cold water immersion. It would appear beneficial to consider a 
feeding supplement for the low-fat individual if immersion was in a more thermal 
stressful environment or extended for a protracted period of time.

Metabolic and thermal adaptations resulting from endurance training in hot vs. 
cold water were compared. It was hypothesized that training in hot water would 
have greater effects on muscle glycogen use and blood lactate accumulation 
during exercise than training in cold water. Eighteen men exercised at 60% of 
maximal oxygen uptake while immersed in hot (n = 9) or cold water (n = 9) for 1 
h, 5 days/wk, for 8 wk. Training in hot water (35 degrees C) potentiated body 
temperature increases during exercise, and training in cold water (20 degrees C) 
blunted body temperature increases during exercise. Before and after training, 
cardiorespiratory and thermoregulatory responses and muscle glycogen and blood 
lactate changes were assessed during a 1-h exercise trial in hot water and, on a 
separate day using the same intensity, in cold water. Oxygen uptake was similar 
for all trials, averaging 2.0 +/- 0.1 l/min. It was observed that 1) training 
reduced glycogen use and lactate accumulation during exercise, with no 
difference between cold and hot water training groups in the magnitude of this 
effect; 2) lactate accumulation during exercise was the same in hot water as in 
cold water; and 3) skin temperature decreased more rapidly during cold-water 
exercise after than before training, with no difference between cold and hot 
water training groups in the magnitude of this effect. Thus, exercise-induced 
body temperature increases are not an important stimulus for glycogen-sparing 
effects and blunted lactate accumulation associated with endurance training.

Are beta-endorphins and thermoregulation during cold-water immersion related?

The purpose of this investigation was to determine the relationship between core 
temperature (Tre), tissue insulation (I), and beta-endorphins (beta-END) during 
immersion in cold water. To test this, 21 males were immersed to the first 
thoracic vertebra for 120 min in stirred water at either 18 degrees, 22 degrees, 
or 26 degrees C. Subjects were divided with respect to body fat [high fat (HF) = 
18-22%, n = 11; low fat (LF) = 8-12%, n = 10] and randomly assigned to one of 
the three temperatures. Blood was drawn at 25 and 5 min (T-25 and T-5, 
respectively) before immersion, after 1 h of immersion, and 5 min before the 
completion of the second hour (T + 60 and T + 120, respectively). No significant 
relationship was found between delta beta-END and delta I or delta Tre. The 
relationship between the changes in thermoregulatory variables and delta 
beta-END did not differ between the HF and LF groups. Also, beta-END (adjusted 
for plasma volume) was lower (P < 0.05) in the HF vs. the LF group. beta-END 
(pg.ml-1) increased (P < 0.05) as time increased from T-25 to T + 60 and were 
not progressive with duration of immersion. Thus, beta-END did not increase in 
proportion to level of heat loss.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a reduced availability of 
plasma free fatty acids (FFA) would impair human temperature regulation during 
cold exposure. Seven seminude male subjects were immersed on two occasions in 18 
degrees C water for 90 min or until their rectal temperature (Tre) decreased to 
35.5 degrees C. The immersion occurred after 2 h of intermittent oral ingestion 
of either nicotinic acid (NIC) or a placebo (PLAC). Plasma FFA levels 
immediately before the immersion were significantly lower in NIC (87 +/- 15 
mumol/l) than in PLAC (655 +/- 116 mumol/l, P less than 0.05). Although FFA 
levels increased by 73% in NIC during the immersion (P less than 0.05), they 
remained significantly lower than in PLAC (151 +/- 19 vs. 716 +/- 74 mumol/l, P 
less than 0.05) throughout the immersion. Muscle glycogen concentrations in the 
vastus lateralis decreased after cold water immersion in both trials (P less 
than 0.05), but the rate of glycogen utilization was similar, averaging 1.00 +/- 
0.27 mmol glucose unit.kg dry muscle-1.min-1). Plasma glucose levels were 
significantly reduced after immersion in both trials (P less than 0.05), this 
decrease being greater in NIC (1.3 +/- 0.2 mmol/l) than in PLAC (0.7 +/- 0.1 
mmol/l, P less than 0.05). O2 uptake increased to 3.8 +/- 0.3 times preimmersion 
values in both trials (P less than 0.05). Mean respiratory exchange ratio (RER) 
immediately before the immersion was greater in NIC (0.87 +/- 0.02) than in PLAC 
(0.77 +/- 0.01, P less than 0.05). Cold exposure increased RER in PLAC but not 
in NIC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
