Immediately postexercise, subjects <br>were exposed in a randomized crossover design to CWI (10 min at 10°C) or WBC (3 <br>min at -110°C) recovery. Creatine kinase concentrations, knee-flexor eccentric <br>(60°/s) and posterior lower-limb isometric (60°) strength, single-leg and 2-leg <br>countermovement jumps, muscle soreness, and perception of recovery were <br>measured. The tests were performed before and immediately, 24, 48, and 72 h <br>after exercise.<br>RESULTS: Results showed a very likely moderate effect in favor of CWI for <br>single-leg (effect size [ES] = 0.63; 90% confidence interval [CI] = -0.13 to <br>1.38) and 2-leg countermovement jump (ES = 0.68; 90% CI = -0.08 to 1.43) 72 h <br>after exercise. Soreness was moderately lower 48 h after exercise after CWI (ES <br>= -0.68; 90% CI = -1.44 to 0.07). Perception of recovery was moderately enhanced <br>24 h after exercise for CWI (ES = -0.62; 90% CI = -1.38 to 0.13). Trivial and <br>small effects of condition were found for the other outcomes.<br>CONCLUSIONS: CWI was more effective than WBC in accelerating recovery kinetics <br>for countermovement-jump performance at 72 h postexercise. CWI also demonstrated <br>lower soreness and higher perceived recovery levels across 24-48 h postexercise.<br><br>DOI: 10.1123/ijspp.2016-0186<br>PMID: 27396361 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

The largest reductions in average (WBC, <br>12.1 ± 1.0°C; CWI, 8.4 ± 0.7°C), minimum (WBC, 13.2 ± 1.4°C; CWI, 8.7 ± 0.7°C) <br>and maximum (WBC, 8.8 ± 2.0°C; CWI, 7.2 ± 1.9°C) skin temperature occurred <br>immediately after both CWI and WBC (P<0.05). Skin temperature was significantly <br>lower (P<0.05) immediately after WBC compared to CWI. The present study <br>demonstrates that a single WBC exposure decreases muscle and core temperature to <br>a similar level of those experienced after CWI. Although both treatments <br>significantly reduced skin temperature, WBC elicited a greater decrease compared <br>to CWI. These data may provide information to clinicians and researchers <br>attempting to optimise WBC and CWI protocols in a clinical or sporting setting.<br><br>DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0048190<br>PMCID: PMC3491015<br>PMID: 23139763 [Indexed for MEDLINE]<br><br>Conflict of interest statement: Competing Interests: The authors have declared <br>that no competing interests exist.",

However, few studies have compared the effect of <br>different cold modalities on nerve conduction parameters.<br>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of ice pack, ice <br>massage, and cold water immersion on the conduction parameters of the sural <br>(sensorial) and tibial motor nerves.<br>DESIGN: An experimental study was conducted in which the participants were <br>randomly assigned to 1 of 3 intervention groups (n=12 per group). Independent <br>variables were cold modality and pre- and post-cooling measurement time. <br>Dependent variables were skin temperature and nerve conduction parameters.<br>METHODS: Thirty-six people who were healthy, with a mean (SD) age of 20.5 (1.9) <br>years, participated in the study. Each group received 1 of the 3 cold <br>modalities, applied to the right calf region for 15 minutes. Skin temperature <br>and nerve conduction parameters were measured before and immediately after <br>cooling.<br>RESULTS: All 3 modalities reduced skin temperature (mean=18.2 degrees C). There <br>also was a reduction in amplitude and an increase in latency and duration of the <br>compound action potential. Ice massage, ice pack, and cold water immersion <br>reduced sensory nerve conduction velocity (NCV) by 20.4, 16.7, and 22.6 m/s and <br>motor NCV by 2.5, 2.1, and 8.3 m/s, respectively. Cold water immersion was the <br>most effective modality in changing nerve conduction parameters.<br>LIMITATIONS: The cooling area of the ice massage and ice pack was smaller than <br>that of the cold water immersion. The examiner was not blinded to the treatment <br>group. The population included only participants who were healthy and young.<br>CONCLUSIONS: All 3 modalities were effective in reducing skin temperature and <br>changing sensory conduction at a physiological level that is sufficient to <br>induce a hypoalgesic effect. The results suggest that cold water immersion, as <br>applied in this study, is the most indicated modality for inducing therapeutic <br>effects associated with the reduction of motor nerve conduction.<br><br>DOI: 10.2522/ptj.20090131<br>PMID: 20185615 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

After exercise, subjects immersed <br>one leg in a cold water bath (10°C, COLD) to the level of their gluteal fold for <br>15 min. The contralateral leg remained outside the water bath and served as <br>control (CON). Core body temperature was monitored throughout the experiment, <br>whereas muscle biopsies and muscle temperature (Tm) measurements were obtained <br>from the vastus lateralis before exercise (PRE), immediately postexercise <br>(POST-EX, Tm only), immediately after cooling, and 3 h postexercise (POST-3H).<br>RESULTS: Exercise significantly increased core body temperature (PRE, 37.1°C ± <br>0.4°C vs POST-EX, 39.3°C ± 0.5°C, P < 0.001) and Tm in both CON (PRE, 33.9°C ± <br>0.7°C vs POST-EX, 39.1°C ± 0.5°C) and COLD legs (PRE, 34.2°C ± 0.9°C vs POST-EX, <br>39.4°C ± 0.3°C), respectively (P < 0.001). After cooling, Tm was significantly <br>lower in COLD (28.9°C ± 2.3°C vs 37.0°C ± 0.8°C, P < 0.001) whereas PGC-1α <br>messenger RNA expression was significantly higher in COLD at POST-3H (P = <br>0.014).

The aim of this <br>study was to compare the effects of ecologically valid CWI and WBC protocols on <br>postexercise lower limb thermoregulatory, femoral artery, and cutaneous blood <br>flow responses.<br>METHODS: Ten males completed a continuous cycle exercise protocol at 70% maximal <br>oxygen uptake until a rectal temperature of 38°C was attained. Participants were <br>then exposed to lower-body CWI (8°C) for 10 min, or WBC (-110°C) for 2 min, in a <br>randomized crossover design. Rectal and thigh skin, deep, and superficial muscle <br>temperatures, thigh, and calf skin blood flow (laser Doppler flowmetry), <br>superficial femoral artery blood flow (duplex ultrasound), and arterial blood <br>pressure were measured before, and for 40 min post, cooling interventions.<br>RESULTS: Greater reductions in thigh skin (CWI, -5.9°C ± 1.8°C; WBC, 0.2°C ± <br>0.5°C; P < 0.001) and superficial (CWI, -4.4°C ± 1.3°C; WBC, -1.8°C ± 1.1°C; P < <br>0.001) and deep (CWI, -2.9°C ± 0.8°C; WBC, -1.3°C ± 0.6°C; P < 0.001) muscle <br>temperatures occurred immediately after CWI. Decreases in femoral artery <br>conductance were greater after CWI (CWI, -84% ± 11%; WBC, -59% ± 21%, P < 0.02) <br>and thigh (CWI, -80% ± 5%; WBC, -59% ± 14%, P < 0.001), and calf (CWI, -73% ± <br>13%; WBC, -45% ± 17%, P < 0.001) cutaneous vasoconstriction was greater after <br>CWI. Reductions in rectal temperature were similar between conditions after <br>cooling (CWI, -0.6°C ± 0.4°C; WBC, -0.6°C ± 0.3°C; P = 0.98).<br>CONCLUSION: Greater reductions in blood flow and tissue temperature were <br>observed after CWI in comparison with WBC.

Strength and muscle mass increased more in the ACT group than in the <br>CWI group (P < 0.05). Isokinetic work (19%), type II muscle fibre <br>cross-sectional area (17%) and the number of myonuclei per fibre (26%) increased <br>in the ACT group (all P < 0.05), but not the CWI group. In another study, nine <br>active men performed a bout of single-leg strength exercises on separate days, <br>followed by CWI or ACT. Muscle biopsies were collected before and 2, 24 and 48 h <br>after exercise. The number of satellite cells expressing neural cell adhesion <br>molecule (NCAM) (10-30%) and paired box protein (Pax7) (20-50%) increased 24-48 <br>h after exercise with ACT. The number of NCAM(+) satellite cells increased 48 h <br>after exercise with CWI. NCAM(+) - and Pax7(+) -positive satellite cell numbers <br>were greater after ACT than after CWI (P < 0.05). Phosphorylation of p70S6 <br>kinase(Thr421/Ser424) increased after exercise in both conditions but was <br>greater after ACT (P < 0.05). These data suggest that CWI attenuates the acute <br>changes in satellite cell numbers and activity of kinases that regulate muscle <br>hypertrophy, which may translate to smaller long-term training gains in muscle <br>strength and hypertrophy.

The <br>aim was to compare the effects of ice pack and cold-water immersion on the <br>muscular performance parameters of plantar flexors and muscular activation of <br>the triceps surae. 41 healthy men (mean age: 22.1 years, SD: 2.9) were randomly <br>assigned to cooling with either ice pack (n=20) or cold-water immersion (n=21). <br>Independent variables were cold modality (ice pack or cold-water immersion) and <br>pre- and post-cooling measurement time.

Therefore, this study aimed to assess the effects of whole <br>body cryotherapy (WBC) and cold water immersion (CWI) on markers of recovery <br>following a marathon.<br>METHODS: Thirty-one endurance trained males completed a marathon. Participants <br>were randomly assigned to a CWI, WBC or placebo group. Perceptions of muscle <br>soreness, training stress and markers of muscle function were recorded before <br>the marathon and at 24 and 48 h post exercise. Blood samples were taken at <br>baseline, post intervention and 24 and 48 h post intervention to assess <br>inflammation and muscle damage.<br>RESULTS: WBC had a harmful effect on muscle function compared to CWI post <br>marathon. WBC positively influenced perceptions of training stress compared to <br>CWI. With the exception of C-reactive protein (CRP) at 24 and 48 h, neither <br>cryotherapy intervention positively influenced blood borne markers of <br>inflammation or structural damage compared to placebo.<br>CONCLUSION: The findings show WBC has a negative impact on muscle function, <br>perceptions of soreness and a number of blood parameters compared to CWI, <br>contradicting the suggestion that WBC may be a superior recovery strategy. <br>Further, cryotherapy is no more effective than a placebo intervention at <br>improving functional recovery or perceptions of training stress following a <br>marathon.

Twenty-male soccer players completed one match and <br>were randomly divided into cryotherapy (10 min cold water immersion, 10°C, n = <br>10) and thermoneutral (10 min thermoneutral water immersion, 35°C, n = 10) <br>groups. Muscle damage (creatine kinase, myoglobin), inflammation (C-reactive <br>protein), neuromuscular function (jump and sprint abilities and maximal <br>isometric quadriceps strength), and delayed-onset muscle soreness were evaluated <br>before, within 30 min of the end, and 24 and 48 h after the match. After the <br>match, the players in both groups showed increased plasma creatine kinase <br>activity (30 min, 24 h, 48 h), myoglobin (30 min) and C-reactive protein (30 <br>min, 24 h) concentrations. Peak jump ability and maximal strength were decreased <br>and delayed-onset muscle soreness increased in both groups. However, <br>differential alterations were observed between thermoneutral water and cold <br>water immersion groups in creatine kinase (30 min, 24 h, 48 h), myoglobin (30 <br>min), C-reactive protein (30 min, 24 h, 48 h), quadriceps strength (24 h), and <br>quadriceps (24 h), calf (24 h) and adductor (30 min) delayed-onset muscle <br>soreness.

This study <br>examined the physiological merit of CWI for recovery from high-intensity <br>exercise by investigating if the placebo effect is responsible for any acute <br>performance or psychological benefits.<br>METHODS: Thirty males (mean ± SD: age, 24 ± 5 yr; VO2 peak, 51.1 ± 7.0 mL · <br>kg(-1) · min(-1)) performed an acute high-intensity interval training session, <br>comprised of 4 × 30-s sprints, immediately followed by one of the following <br>three 15-min recovery conditions: CWI (10.3°C ± 0.2°C), thermoneutral water <br>immersion placebo (TWP) (34.7°C ± 0.1°C), or thermoneutral water immersion <br>control (TWI) (34.7°C ± 0.1°C). An intramuscular thermistor was inserted during <br>exercise and recovery to record muscle temperature. Swelling (thigh girth), pain <br>threshold/tolerance, interleukin 6 concentration, and total leukocyte, <br>neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts were recorded at baseline, postexercise, <br>postrecovery, and 1, 24, and 48 h postexercise. A maximal voluntary isometric <br>contraction (MVC) of the quadriceps was performed at the same time points, with <br>the exception of postexercise. Self-assessments of readiness for exercise, <br>fatigue, vigor, sleepiness, pain, and belief of recovery effectiveness were also <br>completed.<br>RESULTS: Leg strength after the MVC and ratings of readiness for exercise, pain, <br>and vigor were significantly impaired in TWI compared with those in CWI and TWP <br>which were similar to each other.<br>CONCLUSIONS: A recovery placebo administered after an acute high-intensity <br>interval training session is superior in the recovery of muscle strength over 48 <br>h as compared with TWI and is as effective as CWI. This can be attributed to <br>improved ratings of readiness for exercise, pain, and vigor, suggesting that the <br>commonly hypothesized physiological benefits surrounding CWI are at least partly <br>placebo related.<br><br>DOI: 10.1249/MSS.0000000000000348<br>PMID: 24674975 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

After performing a bout of damage-inducing eccentric exercise (eight <br>sets of five maximal reciprocal contractions at 0.58 rad x s(-1)) of the elbow <br>flexors on an isokinetic dynamometer, 15 females aged 22.0+/-2.0 years (mean +/- <br>s) were allocated to a control group (no treatment, n = 7) or a cryotherapy <br>group (n = 8). Subjects in the cryotherapy group immersed their exercised arm in <br>cold water (15 degrees C) for 15 min immediately after eccentric exercise and <br>then every 12 h for 15 min for a total of seven sessions. Muscle tenderness, <br>plasma creatine kinase activity, relaxed elbow angle, isometric strength and <br>swelling (upper arm circumference) were measured immediately before and for 3 <br>days after eccentric exercise. Analysis of variance revealed significant (P < <br>0.05) main effects for time for all variables, with increases in muscle <br>tenderness, creatine kinase activity and upper arm circumference, and decreases <br>in isometric strength and relaxed elbow angle. There were significant <br>interactions (P<0.05) of group x time for relaxed elbow angle and creatine <br>kinase activity. Relaxed elbow angle was greater and creatine kinase activity <br>lower for the cryotherapy group than the controls on days 2 and 3 following the <br>eccentric exercise. We conclude that although cold water immersion may reduce <br>muscle stiffness and the amount of post-exercise damage after strenuous <br>eccentric activity, there appears to be no effect on the perception of <br>tenderness and strength loss, which is characteristic after this form of <br>activity.<br><br>DOI: 10.1080/026404199366136<br>PMID: 10362390 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Repeated sprint ability, strength, muscle soreness and inflammatory <br>markers were measured across the 48-h post-exercise period. Eleven male <br>team-sport athletes completed three 3-day testing trials, each separated by 2 <br>weeks. On day 1, baseline measures of performance (10 m x 20 m sprints and <br>isometric strength of quadriceps, hamstrings and hip flexors) were recorded. <br>Participants then performed 80 min of simulated team sports exercise followed by <br>a 20-m shuttle run test to exhaustion. Upon completion of the exercise, and 24h <br>later, participants performed one of the post-exercise recovery procedures for <br>15 min. At 48 h post-exercise, the performance tests were repeated. Blood <br>samples and muscle soreness ratings were taken before and immediately after <br>post-exercise, and at 24h and 48 h post-exercise. In comparison to the control <br>and CWI treatments, COLD resulted in significantly lower (p<0.05) muscle <br>soreness ratings, as well as in reduced decrements to isometric leg extension <br>and flexion strength in the 48-h post-exercise period. COLD also facilitated a <br>more rapid return to baseline repeated sprint performances. The only benefit of <br>CWI over control was a significant reduction in muscle soreness 24h <br>post-exercise. This study demonstrated that COLD following exhaustive simulated <br>team sports exercise offers greater recovery benefits than CWI or control <br>treatments.<br><br>DOI: 10.1016/j.jsams.2007.12.011<br>PMID: 18547863 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Every sixth rotation, participants <br>performed 5 × 10-m runs, receiving a shoulder-led tackle to the lower body on <br>each effort. Sprint time and distance covered during ISE were recorded, with <br>voluntary (maximal voluntary contraction; MVC) and evoked neuromuscular function <br>(voluntary activation; VA), electromyogram (root mean square (RMS)), ratings of <br>perceived muscle soreness (MS), capillary and venous blood markers for <br>metabolites and muscle damage, respectively measured before and after exercise, <br>immediately after recovery, and 2 and 24 h after recovery.<br>RESULTS: Total distance covered during exercise was significantly greater in <br>CONT (P = 0.01), without differences between TPASS and TCWI (P > 0.05). TCWI <br>resulted in increased MVC, VA, and RMS immediately after recovery (P < 0.05). <br>M-wave amplitude and peak twitch were significantly increased after recovery and <br>2 h after recovery, respectively, in TCWI (P < 0.05). Although TCWI had no <br>effect on the elevation in blood markers for muscle damage (P > 0.05), lactate <br>was significantly reduced after recovery compared with TPASS (P = 0.04). CWI <br>also resulted in reduced MS 2 h after recovery compared with TPASS (P < 0.05).<br>CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of body contact reduces exercise performance, <br>whereas the use of CWI results in a faster recovery of MVC, VA, and RMS and <br>improves muscle contractile properties and perceptions of soreness after <br>collision-based exercise.<br><br>DOI: 10.1249/MSS.0b013e31822b0977<br>PMID: 21716151 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Using a randomized, cross-over design, 10 physically active men <br>performed high-intensity resistance exercise followed by one of two recovery <br>interventions: 1) 10 min of CWI at 10°C or 2) 10 min of active recovery <br>(low-intensity cycling). After the recovery interventions, maximal muscle <br>function was assessed after 2 and 4 h by measuring jump height and isometric <br>squat strength. Submaximal muscle function was assessed after 6 h by measuring <br>the average load lifted during 6 sets of 10 squats at 80% of 1 repetition <br>maximum. Intramuscular temperature (1 cm) was also recorded, and venous blood <br>samples were analyzed for markers of metabolism, vasoconstriction, and muscle <br>damage. CWI did not enhance recovery of maximal muscle function. However, during <br>the final three sets of the submaximal muscle function test, participants lifted <br>a greater load (P < 0.05, Cohen's effect size: 1.3, 38%) after CWI compared with <br>active recovery. During CWI, muscle temperature decreased ∼7°C below <br>postexercise values and remained below preexercise values for another 35 min. <br>Venous blood O2 saturation decreased below preexercise values for 1.5 h after <br>CWI. Serum endothelin-1 concentration did not change after CWI, whereas it <br>decreased after active recovery. Plasma myoglobin concentration was lower, <br>whereas plasma IL-6 concentration was higher after CWI compared with active <br>recovery. These results suggest that CWI after resistance exercise allows <br>athletes to complete more work during subsequent training sessions, which could <br>enhance long-term training adaptations.<br><br>Copyright © 2014 the American Physiological Society.<br><br>DOI: 10.1152/ajpregu.00180.2014<br>PMID: 25121612 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Twenty-two <br>healthy Division I collegiate soccer players (13 men and 9 women; age, 19.8 ± <br>1.1 years; height, 174.0 ± 9.0 cm; mass, 72.1 ± 9.1 kg) volunteered as <br>participants during the noncompetitive season.

Countermovement vertical jump (CMVJ) was used to assess <br>anaerobic power and was measured before YIRT, immediately post-YIRT, and 24 and <br>48 hours post-YIRT. A 10-cm horizontal visual analog scale was administered <br>immediately, 24 hours and 48 hours post-YIRT to assess perceived fatigue (PF) in <br>the legs.

Ten subjects completed <br>two testing sessions separated by 1 week; each trial consisted of an initial <br>all-out 35-min exercise bout, one of two 15-min recovery interventions <br>(randomised: CWI or ACT), followed by a 40-min passive recovery period before <br>repeating the 35-min exercise bout. Performance was measured as the change in <br>total work completed during the exercise bouts. Resting limb blood flow, heart <br>rate, rectal temperature and blood lactate were recorded throughout the testing <br>sessions. There was a significant decline in performance after ACT (mean (SD) <br>-1.81% (1.05%)) compared with CWI where performance remained unchanged (0.10% <br>(0.71%)). Rectal temperature was reduced after CWI (36.8°C (1.0°C)) compared <br>with ACT (38.3°C (0.4°C)), as was blood flow to the arms (CWI 3.64 (1.47) ml/100 <br>ml/min; ACT 16.85 (3.57) ml/100 ml/min) and legs (CW 4.83 (2.49) ml/100 ml/min; <br>ACT 4.83 (2.49) ml/100 ml/min). Leg blood flow at the end of the second exercise <br>bout was not different between the active (15.25 (4.33) ml/100 ml/min) and cold <br>trials (14.99 (4.96) ml/100 ml/min), whereas rectal temperature (CWI 38.1°C <br>(0.3°C); ACT 38.8°C (0.2°C)) and arm blood flow (CWI 20.55 (3.78) ml/100 ml/min; <br>ACT 23.83 (5.32) ml/100 ml/min) remained depressed until the end of the cold <br>trial.

Circulating <br>mediators of the inflammatory response were measured from EDTA plasma taken <br>pre-exercise (baseline), immediately post-exercise, and at 2, 24, and 48 h <br>post-exercise. Ratings of perceived soreness and impairment were noted on a <br>10-pt Likert scale, and squat jump and drop jump were performed at these time <br>points.<br>RESULTS: IL-6, IL-8, and MPO increased significantly from baseline immediately <br>post-exercise in all conditions.

Countermovement jump height, muscle soreness and perceived <br>recovery and stress were measured 24h before the half-marathon (pre), <br>immediately after the recovery intervention (postrec) and 24h after the race <br>(post24). In addition, muscle contractile properties and blood markers of <br>fatigue were determined at pre and post24.<br>RESULTS: Magnitude-based inferences revealed substantial differences in the <br>changes between the groups. At postrec, ACT was harmful to perceived recovery <br>(ACT vs. PAS: effect size [ES] = -1.81) and serum concentration of creatine <br>kinase (ACT vs. PAS: ES = 0.42), with CWI being harmful to jump performance (CWI <br>vs. PAS: ES = -0.98). It was also beneficial for reducing muscle soreness (CWI <br>vs. PAS: ES = -0.88) and improving perceived stress (CWI vs. PAS: ES = -0.64), <br>with MAS being beneficial for reducing muscle soreness (MAS vs. PAS: ES = -0.52) <br>and improving perceived recovery (MAS vs. PAS: ES = 1.00). At post24, both CWI <br>and MAS were still beneficial for reducing muscle soreness (CWI vs. PAS: ES = <br>1.49; MAS vs. PAS: ES = 1.12), with ACT being harmful to perceived recovery (ACT <br>vs. PAS: ES = -0.68), serum concentration of creatine kinase (ACT vs. PAS: ES = <br>0.84) and free-testosterone (ACT vs. PAS: ES = -0.91).<br>CONCLUSIONS: In recreational runners, a half-marathon results in fatigue <br>symptoms lasting at least 24h. To restore subjective fatigue measures, the <br>authors recommend CWI and MAS, as these recovery strategies are more effective <br>than PAS, with ACT being even disadvantageous. However, runners must be aware <br>that neither the use of ACT nor CWI or MAS had any beneficial effect on <br>objective fatigue markers.<br><br>DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0207313<br>PMCID: PMC6226207<br>PMID: 30412626 [Indexed for MEDLINE]<br><br>Conflict of interest statement: The authors have declared that no competing <br>interests exist.",

Twenty males (mean age 22.3 years, s = 3.3; height 1.80 <br>m, s = 0.05; body mass 83.7 kg, s = 11.9) completed a 90-min intermittent <br>shuttle run previously shown to result in marked muscle damage and soreness. <br>After exercise, participants were randomly assigned to either 10 min cold-water <br>immersion (mean 10 degrees C, s = 0.5) or a non-immersion control group. Ratings <br>of perceived soreness, changes in muscular function and efflux of intracellular <br>proteins were monitored before exercise, during treatment, and at regular <br>intervals up to 7 days post-exercise. Exercise resulted in severe muscle <br>soreness, temporary muscular dysfunction, and elevated serum markers of muscle <br>damage, all peaking within 48 h after exercise. Cryotherapy administered <br>immediately after exercise reduced muscle soreness at 1, 24, and 48 h (P < <br>0.05). Decrements in isometric maximal voluntary contraction of the knee flexors <br>were reduced after cryotherapy treatment at 24 (mean 12%, s(x) = 4) and 48 h <br>(mean 3%, s(x) = 3) compared with the control group (mean 21%, s(x) = 5 and mean <br>14%, s(x) = 5 respectively; P < 0.05). Exercise-induced increases in serum <br>myoglobin concentration and creatine kinase activity peaked at 1 and 24 h, <br>respectively (P < 0.05). Cryotherapy had no effect on the creatine kinase <br>response, but reduced myoglobin 1 h after exercise (P < 0.05).

The interventions were <br>performed in a randomized order with a 1-week wash-out period. We tested <br>athletes before and after each intervention week regarding swim (100 m freestyle <br>sprints) and functional performance (flexibility, upper and lower body power, <br>and shoulder proprioception). We monitored athlete's perceptions (well-being, <br>heaviness, tiredness, discomfort and pain) during testing sessions using a <br>5-item questionnaire. Athlete preferences regarding the interventions were <br>assessed at the end of the study. We used generalized linear mixed models and <br>generalized estimating equations for continuous and categorical variables, <br>respectively (intervention x time).<br>RESULTS: We found a time effect for swim performance (p = .01) in which, <br>regardless the intervention, all athletes improved sprint time at <br>post-intervention compared to baseline. There was an intervention effect for <br>pain (p = .04) and tiredness (p = .04), but with no significant post-hoc <br>comparisons. We found no significant effects for other outcomes. All athletes <br>reported a preference for CWI or TWI in relation to PAS.<br>CONCLUSION: The repeated use of CWI throughout a training week did not impact <br>functional or swim performance outcomes of competitive adolescent swimmers. <br>Perceptive outcomes were also similar across interventions; however, athletes <br>indicated a preference for both CWI and TWI.<br><br>© 2024.

In a randomized design, eight soccer players completed the Loughborough <br>Intermittent Shuttle Test followed by 10 min of either CWI (10C°) or <br>thermoneutral water immersion (TWI) (28C°). Physical performance (Squat jump: <br>SJ, countermovement jump: CMJ, maximal voluntary contraction: MVC, and 20 m <br>sprint: SP), muscle damage parameter (creatine kinase: CK) and perceived muscle <br>soreness were assessed at baseline, 0 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h after the <br>intermittent test.

After <br>week 1 training, all players completed a passive recovery (PAS). During week 2, <br>COLD or CWT was randomly assigned. Players undertook the opposing intervention <br>in week 3. Repeat-sprint ability (6 × 20 m), countermovement and squat jumps, <br>perceived muscle soreness, and fatigue were measured pretraining and over 48 h <br>posttraining.<br>RESULTS: Immediately posttraining, groups exhibited similar performance and <br>psychometric declines. At 24 h, repeat-sprint time had deteriorated by 4.1% for <br>PAS and 1.0% for CWT but was fully restored by COLD (0.0%). At 24 and 48 h, both <br>COLD and CWT attenuated changes in mean muscle soreness, with COLD (0.6 ± 0.6 <br>and 0.0 ± 0.4) more effective than CWT (1.9 ± 0.7 and 1.0 ± 0.7) and PAS having <br>minimal effect (5.5 ± 0.6 and 4.0 ± 0.5). Similarly, after 24 and 48 h, COLD and <br>CWT both effectively reduced changes in perceived fatigue, with COLD (0.6 ± 0.6 <br>and 0.0 ± 0.6) being more successful than CWT (0.8 ± 0.6 and 0.7 ± 0.6) and PAS <br>having the smallest effect (2.2 ± 0.8 and 2.4 ± 0.6).<br>CONCLUSIONS: AF training can result in prolonged physical and psychometric <br>deficits persisting for up to 48 h.

However, few studies have compared the effect of <br>different cold modalities on nerve conduction parameters.<br>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of ice pack, ice <br>massage, and cold water immersion on the conduction parameters of the sural <br>(sensorial) and tibial motor nerves.<br>DESIGN: An experimental study was conducted in which the participants were <br>randomly assigned to 1 of 3 intervention groups (n=12 per group). Independent <br>variables were cold modality and pre- and post-cooling measurement time. <br>Dependent variables were skin temperature and nerve conduction parameters.<br>METHODS: Thirty-six people who were healthy, with a mean (SD) age of 20.5 (1.9) <br>years, participated in the study. Each group received 1 of the 3 cold <br>modalities, applied to the right calf region for 15 minutes. Skin temperature <br>and nerve conduction parameters were measured before and immediately after <br>cooling.<br>RESULTS: All 3 modalities reduced skin temperature (mean=18.2 degrees C). There <br>also was a reduction in amplitude and an increase in latency and duration of the <br>compound action potential. Ice massage, ice pack, and cold water immersion <br>reduced sensory nerve conduction velocity (NCV) by 20.4, 16.7, and 22.6 m/s and <br>motor NCV by 2.5, 2.1, and 8.3 m/s, respectively. Cold water immersion was the <br>most effective modality in changing nerve conduction parameters.<br>LIMITATIONS: The cooling area of the ice massage and ice pack was smaller than <br>that of the cold water immersion. The examiner was not blinded to the treatment <br>group. The population included only participants who were healthy and young.<br>CONCLUSIONS: All 3 modalities were effective in reducing skin temperature and <br>changing sensory conduction at a physiological level that is sufficient to <br>induce a hypoalgesic effect. The results suggest that cold water immersion, as <br>applied in this study, is the most indicated modality for inducing therapeutic <br>effects associated with the reduction of motor nerve conduction.<br><br>DOI: 10.2522/ptj.20090131<br>PMID: 20185615 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Twenty-eight females were allocated to PBC <br>(30 seconds at -60°C, 2 minutes at -135°C), CWI (10 minutes at 10°C), or CON <br>(10 minutes resting). Muscle oxygen saturation (SmO2 ), cutaneous vascular <br>conductance (CVC), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and local skin temperature were <br>assessed at baseline and through 60 minutes (10-minute intervals), while delayed <br>onset of muscle soreness (DOMS), muscle swelling, maximum voluntary isometric <br>contraction (MVIC), and vertical jump performance (VJP) were assessed up to <br>72 hours (24-hour intervals) following treatments. SmO2 was lower in PBC <br>(Δ-2.77 ± 13.08%) and CWI (Δ-5.91 ± 11.80%) compared with CON (Δ18.96 ± 1.46%) <br>throughout the 60-minute follow-up period (P < .001). CVC was lower from PBC <br>(92.7 ± 25.0%, 90.5 ± 23.4%) and CWI (90.3 ± 23.5%, 88.1 ± 22.9%) compared with <br>CON (119.0 ± 5.1 and 116.1 ± 6.6%, respectively) between 20 and 30 minutes <br>(P < .05).

In the present study we compared the <br>short-term effects of cold water immersion therapy (CWIT) and light emitting <br>diode therapy (LEDT) with placebo LEDT on biochemical markers related to <br>skeletal muscle recovery after high-intensity exercise. A randomized <br>double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial was performed with six male <br>young futsal athletes. They were treated with CWIT (5°C of temperature [SD <br>±1°]), active LEDT (69 LEDs with wavelengths 660/850 nm, 10/30 mW of output <br>power, 30 s of irradiation time per point, and 41.7 J of total energy irradiated <br>per point, total of ten points irradiated) or an identical placebo LEDT 5 min <br>after each of three Wingate cycle tests. Pre-exercise, post-exercise, and <br>post-treatment measurements were taken of blood lactate levels, creatine kinase <br>(CK) activity, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. There were no significant <br>differences in the work performed during the three Wingate tests (p > 0.05). All <br>biochemical parameters increased from baseline values (p < 0.05) after the three <br>exercise tests, but only active LEDT decreased blood lactate levels (p = 0.0065) <br>and CK activity (p = 0.0044) significantly after treatment. There were no <br>significant differences in CRP values after treatments. We concluded that <br>treating the leg muscles with LEDT 5 min after the Wingate cycle test seemed to <br>inhibit the expected post-exercise increase in blood lactate levels and CK <br>activity. This suggests that LEDT has better potential than 5 min of CWIT for <br>improving short-term post-exercise recovery.<br><br>DOI: 10.1007/s10103-010-0866-x<br>PMCID: PMC3119799<br>PMID: 21088862 [Indexed for MEDLINE]<br><br>Conflict of interest statement: The authors declare that they have no conflicts <br>of interest.",

Twenty-three under-20 semi-professionals male soccer players <br>were randomly allocated into cold water immersion group (bathtub with water and <br>ice at 10 °C ± 1 °C for 10 min) or control group (rest for 10 min), every day, <br>after training sessions during a preseason.

The ISE consisted of a 15-m <br>sprint every minute separated by self-paced bouts of hard running, jogging, and <br>walking for the remainder of the minute. Every sixth rotation, participants <br>performed 5 × 10-m runs, receiving a shoulder-led tackle to the lower body on <br>each effort. Sprint time and distance covered during ISE were recorded, with <br>voluntary (maximal voluntary contraction; MVC) and evoked neuromuscular function <br>(voluntary activation; VA), electromyogram (root mean square (RMS)), ratings of <br>perceived muscle soreness (MS), capillary and venous blood markers for <br>metabolites and muscle damage, respectively measured before and after exercise, <br>immediately after recovery, and 2 and 24 h after recovery.<br>RESULTS: Total distance covered during exercise was significantly greater in <br>CONT (P = 0.01), without differences between TPASS and TCWI (P > 0.05). TCWI <br>resulted in increased MVC, VA, and RMS immediately after recovery (P < 0.05). <br>M-wave amplitude and peak twitch were significantly increased after recovery and <br>2 h after recovery, respectively, in TCWI (P < 0.05). Although TCWI had no <br>effect on the elevation in blood markers for muscle damage (P > 0.05), lactate <br>was significantly reduced after recovery compared with TPASS (P = 0.04). CWI <br>also resulted in reduced MS 2 h after recovery compared with TPASS (P < 0.05).<br>CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of body contact reduces exercise performance, <br>whereas the use of CWI results in a faster recovery of MVC, VA, and RMS and <br>improves muscle contractile properties and perceptions of soreness after <br>collision-based exercise.<br><br>DOI: 10.1249/MSS.0b013e31822b0977<br>PMID: 21716151 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

The recovery intervention consisted of different water <br>immersion techniques, including: temperate water immersion (36°C; TWI), cold <br>water immersion (10°C; CWI), contrast water temperature (10-42°C; CWT) and a <br>passive recovery (PAS). Performances during a maximal 30-s rowing test (P(30 <br>s)), a maximal vertical counter-movement jump (CMJ) and a maximal isometric <br>voluntary contraction (MVC) of the knee extensor muscles were measured at rest <br>(Pre-exercise), immediately after the exercise (Post-exercise), 1 h after (Post <br>1 h) and 24 h later (Post 24 h). Leukocyte profile and venous blood markers of <br>muscle damage (creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)) were also <br>measured Pre-exercise, Post 1 h and Post 24 h. A significant time effect was <br>observed to indicate a reduction in performance (Pre-exercise vs. Post-exercise) <br>following the exercise bout in all conditions (P < 0.05). Indeed, at 1 h post <br>exercise, a significant improvement in MVC and P(30 s) was respectively observed <br>in the CWI and CWT groups compared to pre-exercise. Further, for the CWI group, <br>this result was associated with a comparative blunting of the rise in total <br>number of leucocytes at 1 h post and of plasma concentration of CK at 24 h post. <br>The results indicate that the practice of cold water immersion and contrast <br>water therapy are more effective immersion modalities to promote a faster acute <br>recovery of maximal anaerobic performances (MVC and 30″ all-out respectively) <br>after an intermittent exhaustive exercise.

Using a randomized, cross-over design, 10 physically active men <br>performed high-intensity resistance exercise followed by one of two recovery <br>interventions: 1) 10 min of CWI at 10°C or 2) 10 min of active recovery <br>(low-intensity cycling).

Intramuscular temperature (1 cm) was also recorded, and venous blood <br>samples were analyzed for markers of metabolism, vasoconstriction, and muscle <br>damage. CWI did not enhance recovery of maximal muscle function. However, during <br>the final three sets of the submaximal muscle function test, participants lifted <br>a greater load (P < 0.05, Cohen's effect size: 1.3, 38%) after CWI compared with <br>active recovery. During CWI, muscle temperature decreased ∼7°C below <br>postexercise values and remained below preexercise values for another 35 min. <br>Venous blood O2 saturation decreased below preexercise values for 1.5 h after <br>CWI. Serum endothelin-1 concentration did not change after CWI, whereas it <br>decreased after active recovery. Plasma myoglobin concentration was lower, <br>whereas plasma IL-6 concentration was higher after CWI compared with active <br>recovery.

Thirty physically active males were randomly assigned to either a <br>control (n = 15) or cold-water immersion (CWI) group (n = 15). The CWI group <br>performed one immersion (10 °C for 20 min) at post-exercise and every 24 h for <br>the following 72 h, while the control group remained in a seated position during <br>these corresponding periods.

Countermovement jump height, muscle soreness and perceived <br>recovery and stress were measured 24h before the half-marathon (pre), <br>immediately after the recovery intervention (postrec) and 24h after the race <br>(post24). In addition, muscle contractile properties and blood markers of <br>fatigue were determined at pre and post24.<br>RESULTS: Magnitude-based inferences revealed substantial differences in the <br>changes between the groups. At postrec, ACT was harmful to perceived recovery <br>(ACT vs. PAS: effect size [ES] = -1.81) and serum concentration of creatine <br>kinase (ACT vs. PAS: ES = 0.42), with CWI being harmful to jump performance (CWI <br>vs. PAS: ES = -0.98). It was also beneficial for reducing muscle soreness (CWI <br>vs. PAS: ES = -0.88) and improving perceived stress (CWI vs. PAS: ES = -0.64), <br>with MAS being beneficial for reducing muscle soreness (MAS vs. PAS: ES = -0.52) <br>and improving perceived recovery (MAS vs. PAS: ES = 1.00). At post24, both CWI <br>and MAS were still beneficial for reducing muscle soreness (CWI vs. PAS: ES = <br>1.49; MAS vs. PAS: ES = 1.12), with ACT being harmful to perceived recovery (ACT <br>vs. PAS: ES = -0.68), serum concentration of creatine kinase (ACT vs. PAS: ES = <br>0.84) and free-testosterone (ACT vs. PAS: ES = -0.91).<br>CONCLUSIONS: In recreational runners, a half-marathon results in fatigue <br>symptoms lasting at least 24h.

Twenty-eight male <br>subjects [mean (SD) 23.8 (1.8) years] were randomly assigned to the control <br>(COTG, n=10), cold-water immersion (CWIG, n=9), and double-cold-water immersion <br>groups (DCWIG, n=9). The cold-water immersion (15 min) was administered to the <br>subjects' legs after calf-raise exercise (CWIG: after recording initial <br>post-exercise measures, DCWIG: after recording initial and 24 h post-exercise <br>measures). Magnetic resonance T2-weighted images were obtained to calculate the <br>T2 relaxation time (T2) of the triceps surae muscle before, immediately after, <br>and at the following times post-exercise: 20, 40, and 60 min, and 24, 48, 96 and <br>168 h. In addition, the ankle joint range of motion, serum creatine kinase and <br>lactate dehydrogenase, and muscle soreness level were investigated before and <br>after exercise. In all groups, significant T2 elevations in the gastrocnemius <br>muscle appeared from immediately after to 60 min after exercise (P<0.05). <br>Thereafter, COTG showed significantly re-elevated T2 levels in the gastrocnemius <br>at 96-168 h post-exercise (P<0.05), while CWIG and DCWIG showed significantly <br>smaller T2 values than the COTG at 96 h post-exercise (P<0.05). In addition, <br>COTG showed larger increases in serum enzymes at 96 h post-exercise (not <br>significant) and significantly greater muscle soreness levels at 48 h <br>post-exercise (P<0.05) than the cooling groups. The results of this study may <br>suggest that cooling has no dramatic effect, but some minor effects on reducing <br>exercise-induced muscle edema in the subacute phase and relieving the extent of <br>the damaged muscle cells.<br><br>DOI: 10.1007/s00421-002-0749-3<br>PMID: 12627305 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

The use of <br>cold-water immersion (CWI) as a recovery strategy is common; however, the <br>physiological and biochemical rationale behind its use remains unclear. This <br>study aimed to assess the relationship between body temperature responses to <br>water immersion and individual perception of recovery, with subsequent exercise <br>performance.<br>METHODS: Twelve male rugby players participated in a 3-week cross-over trial <br>where an intense 60 min conditioning session was followed immediately by 15 min <br>of either 14°C CWI, 30°C warm-water immersion (WWI) or passive control (CON) <br>recovery intervention. Postexercise body temperatures and subjective ratings of <br>the recovery intervention were recorded and subsequently related to performance <br>in a 5×40 m repeated sprint protocol undertaken 24 h later.<br>RESULTS: CWI induced large reductions in core body temperature postimmersion <br>(effect size (ES) range 1.05-3.21) and improved subsequent sprint performance <br>compared to WWI (ES 1.04±0.84) and CON (ES 1.44±0.84).

Seventeen (13 male, 4 female) active subjects underwent a <br>crossover, randomised design involving two testing sessions 2 - 6 d apart. <br>Testing involved two 30-s maximal cycling efforts separated by a one-hour <br>recovery period of 10-min cycling warm-down followed by either passive rest or <br>15-min cold water immersion (13 - 14 degrees C) with passive rest. Peak power, <br>total work and postexercise blood lactate were significantly reduced following <br>cold water immersion compared to the first exercise test and the control <br>condition. These variables did not differ significantly between the control <br>tests. Peak exercise heart rate was significantly lower after cold water <br>immersion compared to the control. Time to peak power, rating of perceived <br>exertion, and blood pH were not affected by cold water immersion compared to the <br>control. Core temperature rose significantly (0.3 degrees C) during ice bath <br>immersion but a similar increase also occurred in the control condition. <br>Therefore, cold water immersion caused a significant decrease in sprint cycling <br>performance with one-hour recovery between tests.<br><br>DOI: 10.1055/s-2007-965118<br>PMID: 17534786 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

This study examined the effect of CWI as a recovery <br>strategy on subsequent running performance in normothermic ambient conditions <br>(∼22°C).<br>DESIGN: Nine endurance-trained men completed two submaximal exhaustive running <br>bouts on three separate occasions. The running bouts (Ex1 and Ex2) were <br>separated by 15min of un-immersed seated rest (CON), hip-level CWI at 8°C <br>(CWI-8) or hip-level CWI at 15°C (CWI-15).<br>METHODS: Intestinal temperature, blood lactate and heart rate were recorded <br>throughout and V˙O2, running economy and exercise times were recorded during the <br>running sessions.<br>RESULTS: Running time to failure (min) during Ex2 was significantly (p<0.05, <br>ES=0.7) longer following CWI-8 (27.7±6.3) than CON (23.3±5) but not different <br>between CWI-15 (26.3±3.4) and CON (p=0.06, ES=0.7) or CWI-8 and CWI-15 (p=0.4, <br>ES=0.2). Qualitative analyses showed a 95% and 89% likely beneficial effect of <br>CWI-8 and CWI-15 during Ex2 compared with CON, respectively. Time to failure <br>during Ex2 was significantly shorter than Ex1 only during the CON condition. <br>Intestinal temperature and HR were significantly lower for most of Ex2 during <br>CWI-8 and CWI-15 compared with CON but they were similar at failure for the <br>three conditions. Blood lactate, running economy and V˙O2 were not altered by <br>CWI.<br>CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that a 15min period of cold water immersion <br>applied between repeated exhaustive exercise bouts significantly reduces <br>intestinal temperature and enhances post-immersion running performance in <br>normothermic conditions.<br><br>Copyright © 2012 Sports Medicine Australia.

On each occasion, they had to perform two climbing tests (C1 <br>and C2) until volitional exhaustion on a prepracticed route (overhanging wall, <br>level 6b). These two tests were separated by 20 min of recovery. Four recovery <br>methods were used in randomized order: passive recovery, active recovery (cycle <br>ergometer, 30-40 W), electromyostimulation on the forearm muscles (bisymmetric <br>TENS current), or cold water immersion of the forearms and arms (three periods <br>of 5 min at 15 +/- 1 degrees C). Climbing tests' performance was reflected by <br>the number of arm movements and climb duration.<br>RESULTS: Using active recovery and cold water immersion, performance at C2 was <br>maintained in comparison with C1, whereas C2 performance was impaired compared <br>with C1 (P< 0.01) using electromyostimulation and passive recovery (recovery <br>method-by-climb interaction, P < 0.05). Blood lactate decreased during recovery, <br>with the greatest decrease occurring during active recovery (time-by-recovery <br>method interaction, P < 0.001). Arms and forearms' skin temperatures were lower <br>throughout the cold water immersion compared with the other three methods (P < <br>0.001).<br>CONCLUSION: Active recovery and cold water immersion are two means of preserving <br>performance when repeating acute exhausting climbing trails in female climbers. <br>These positive effects are accompanied by a greater lactate removal and a <br>decrease in subcutaneous tissues temperatures, respectively.<br><br>DOI: 10.1249/MSS.0b013e318195107d<br>PMID: 19461534 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Ten <br>female netball players performed four randomized sessions of a simulated netball <br>exercise circuit on consecutive days. Each condition consisted of two identical <br>sessions (Session 1 and 2), with the recovery intervention implemented at the <br>completion of Session 1. Participants performed all interventions involving: <br>passive recovery, active recovery (ACT), cold water immersion (CWI) and contrast <br>water therapy (C(T)WT). No significant differences (p > 0.05) were evident <br>between conditions for exercise performance (vertical jump, 20-m sprint, 10-m <br>sprint, total circuit time) during Session 2. Effect size data indicated trends <br>for an ameliorated decline in 5 x 20-m sprints and vertical jump for C(T)WT and <br>CWI, respectively. C(T)WT demonstrated a significant reduction (p = 0.04) in <br>lactate post-intervention compared to ACT recovery. Further, ACT recovery <br>resulted in a significantly elevated (p < 0.01) heart rate compared to all other <br>conditions postintervention and demonstrated significantly higher (p < 0.01) <br>rating of perceived exertion postintervention and muscle soreness pre-exercise <br>Session 2. It is likely that while interventions may be applicable to team sport <br>practices, the 24-hour recovery period between exercise bouts was sufficient to <br>allow performance to be maintained, regardless of recovery interventions.<br><br>DOI: 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181b3f81f<br>PMID: 19675481 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Fifteen young active <br>men completed 2 exhaustive cycling protocols (Ex1 and Ex2: 12 min at 85% <br>ventilatory threshold (VT) and then an intermittent exercise alternating 30-s at <br>40% peak power (Ppeak) and 30 s at 90% Ppeak to exhaustion) separated by 15 min <br>of (i) passive rest, (ii) 5-min cold-water immersion at 8 °C, and (iii) 10-min <br>cold-water immersion at 8 °C. Core temperature, heart rate, rates of perceived <br>exertion, and oxygen uptake kinetics were not different during Ex1 among <br>conditions. Time to failure during the intermittent exercise was significantly <br>(P < 0.05) longer during Ex2 following the 5- and 10-min cold-water immersions <br>(7.2 ± 3.5 min and 7.3 ± 3.3 min, respectively) compared with passive rest (5.8 <br>± 3.1 min).

Twenty-two professional male rugby players were randomized into <br>CWI (10 °C/10 min; n = 11) or control (CON: 30 min seated; n = 11) groups. <br>Activity profile from Global Positioning Satellite systems and postmatch rating <br>of perceived exertion were measured to determined match load. Biochemical (tumor <br>necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6), neuromuscular performance (squat <br>(SJ) and countermovement jumps (CMJ), peak power output (PPO), rate of force <br>development (RFD), stiffness, 10- and 30-m sprint time, and perceptual markers <br>(soreness, perceived recovery) were obtained before and immediately after the <br>match, and then at 30 min, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after the match. Magnitude-based <br>inference and Cohen's effect size (ES) were used to analyze change over time and <br>between groups. Thus, the higher/beneficial, similar/trivial, or lower/harmful <br>differences were evaluated as follows: <1%, almost certainly not; 1% to 5%, very <br>unlikely; 5% to 25%, unlikely; 25% to 75%, possible; 75% to 95%, likely; 95% to <br>99%, very likely; >99%, almost certainly. Changes were unclear for the match <br>loads, sprint times, and perceptual markers between groups. Higher %ΔSJ at 24 h <br>(very likely (ES = 0.75)) and in %ΔPPO_SJ at 48 h (likely (ES = 0.51)) were <br>observed in CWI than in CON.

The purpose of this paper is to determine the influence of CWI <br>immediately following an Ironman triathlon on markers of muscle damage, <br>inflammation and muscle soreness.<br>DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.<br>METHODS: Thirty three (22 male, 11 female), triathletes participating in the <br>Ironman World Championships volunteered to participate (mean±SD: age=40±11years; <br>height=174.5±9.1cm; body mass=70±11.8kg; percent body fat=11.4±4.1%, finish <br>time=11:03.00±01:25.08). Post race, participants were randomly assigned to a <br>10-min bout of 10°C CWI or no-intervention control group. Data collection <br>occurred pre-intervention (PRE), post-intervention (POST), 16h (16POST) and 40h <br>(40POST) following the race. Linear mixed model ANOVA with Bonferroni <br>corrections were performed to examine group by time differences for delayed <br>onset muscle soreness (DOMS), hydration indices, myoglobin, creatine kinase <br>(CK), cortisol, C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6 and percent body mass loss <br>(%BML). Pearson's bivariate correlations were used for comparisons with <br>finishing time. Alpha level was set a priori at 0.05.<br>RESULTS: No significant group by time interactions occurred. Significant <br>differences occurred for POST BML (-1.7±0.9kg) vs. 16POST, and 40POST BML <br>(0.9±1.4, -0.1±1.2kg, respectively; p<0.001). Compared to PRE, myoglobin, CRP <br>and CK remained significantly elevated at 40POST.

Electronic address: <br>p.reaburn@cqu.edu.au.<br><br>Cold water immersion (CWI) and ice massage (IM) are commonly used treatments to <br>prevent the delay onset of muscle soreness (DOMS); however, little is known on <br>their relative benefits and effectiveness to lower tissue temperature. This <br>study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of IM and CMI on tissue <br>temperature and potential benefit to preventing DOMS. The research encompassed <br>36 subjects divided into three groups of twelve depending on the form of <br>recovery: ice massage (IM), cold-water immersion (CWI), or passive recovery <br>(PAS). All the participants were asked to jump as high as possible from a full <br>squat for one minute. Thermal imaging was conducted at rest, immediately <br>following the exercise, immediately after the trial, following the recovery <br>treatment, and after 30min of rest. Their pain levels were assessed using the <br>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). After applying the selected method for supporting <br>recovery, the LA level decreased by 4.25mmol/L in the IM group, and by <br>4.96mmol/L in the CWI group (IM vs. CWI p>0.05). The 2.75mmol/L decrease in <br>lactate concentration in the PAS group was significantly lower than in the other <br>groups (IM vs. PAS p<0.05/ CWI vs. PAS p<0.01). In both groups, Tsk after 30min <br>was significantly lower (ΔTsk~0.5°C) than at rest (p<0.05). In turn, Tsk in the <br>PAS group returned to the resting values (p>0.05). Seventy-two hours after the <br>exercise, a clear decrease in discomfort was observed in the IM and CWI groups <br>compared to the PAS group. The two applied treatments have proven to be <br>effective both in utilizing lactate and preventing DOMS. Depending on training <br>requirements, we recommend the use of IM when athletes experience localized <br>muscle fatigue. One the other hand, CWI is recommended in situations of global <br>or generalized muscle injury or fatigue.<br><br>Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

After performing a bout of damage-inducing eccentric exercise (eight <br>sets of five maximal reciprocal contractions at 0.58 rad x s(-1)) of the elbow <br>flexors on an isokinetic dynamometer, 15 females aged 22.0+/-2.0 years (mean +/- <br>s) were allocated to a control group (no treatment, n = 7) or a cryotherapy <br>group (n = 8). Subjects in the cryotherapy group immersed their exercised arm in <br>cold water (15 degrees C) for 15 min immediately after eccentric exercise and <br>then every 12 h for 15 min for a total of seven sessions. Muscle tenderness, <br>plasma creatine kinase activity, relaxed elbow angle, isometric strength and <br>swelling (upper arm circumference) were measured immediately before and for 3 <br>days after eccentric exercise. Analysis of variance revealed significant (P < <br>0.05) main effects for time for all variables, with increases in muscle <br>tenderness, creatine kinase activity and upper arm circumference, and decreases <br>in isometric strength and relaxed elbow angle. There were significant <br>interactions (P<0.05) of group x time for relaxed elbow angle and creatine <br>kinase activity. Relaxed elbow angle was greater and creatine kinase activity <br>lower for the cryotherapy group than the controls on days 2 and 3 following the <br>eccentric exercise. We conclude that although cold water immersion may reduce <br>muscle stiffness and the amount of post-exercise damage after strenuous <br>eccentric activity, there appears to be no effect on the perception of <br>tenderness and strength loss, which is characteristic after this form of <br>activity.<br><br>DOI: 10.1080/026404199366136<br>PMID: 10362390 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Subjects were examined for <br>performance changes in the squat exercise (total repetitions and average power <br>per repetition), biomarkers of inflammation, and changes in cross-sectional area <br>and echo intensity (EI) of the rectus femoris (RF) and vastus lateralis muscles.<br>RESULTS: No differences between groups were observed in the number of <br>repetitions (P = .250; power: P = .663). Inferential-based analysis indicated <br>that increases in C-reactive protein concentrations were likely increased by a <br>greater magnitude after CWI compared with CON, while NMES possibly decreased <br>more than CON from IP to 24H. Increases in interleukin-10 concentrations between <br>IP and 30 P were likely greater in CWI than NMES but not different from CON. <br>Inferential-based analysis of RF EI indicated a likely decrease for CWI between <br>IP and 48 H. No other differences between groups were noted in any other <br>muscle-architecture measures.<br>CONCLUSIONS: Results indicated that CWI induced greater increases in pro- and <br>anti-inflammatory markers, while decreasing RF EI, suggesting that CWI may be <br>effective in enhancing short-term muscle recovery after high-volume bouts of <br>resistance exercise.<br><br>DOI: 10.1123/jsr.2013-0113<br>PMID: 24622577 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

There are several interventions available for exercise induced <br>muscle damage recovery, but cold-water immersion (CWI) stands out among them. <br>The effects of CWI are unclear in the literature and, although the number of <br>street runners has been growing, there is a gap in the scientific evidence <br>regarding the use of CWI to recover runners' performance after a 10-km street <br>run. Purpose: The goal of our study was to analyze the effects of CWI on the <br>recovery of muscle damage markers after a 10-km street run. Method: We randomly <br>assigned thirty male recreational street runners, immediately after a 10-km <br>street run, into three recovery groups: control (rest for 10 minutes), immersion <br>(10 min immersed in water without ice at room temperature) and CWI (10 min <br>immersed in water with ice at 10ºC). We assessed pain, triple hop distance, <br>extensor peak torque and blood creatine kinase levels pre- and post-run, <br>post-intervention and 24 hours after the run. Results: The 10-km run was enough <br>to decrease triple hop distance and extensor peak torque, and increase levels of <br>creatine kinase (p < 0.05); however, we found no time/group interactions in any <br>of the assessed variables after we applied the appropriate interventions (p > <br>0.05). Conclusion: 10-min CWI at 10°C was no more effective than water immersion <br>and rest in recovering muscle damage markers after 10-km runs.<br><br>DOI: 10.1080/02701367.2019.1659477<br>PMID: 31652109 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

After <br>week 1 training, all players completed a passive recovery (PAS). During week 2, <br>COLD or CWT was randomly assigned. Players undertook the opposing intervention <br>in week 3. Repeat-sprint ability (6 × 20 m), countermovement and squat jumps, <br>perceived muscle soreness, and fatigue were measured pretraining and over 48 h <br>posttraining.<br>RESULTS: Immediately posttraining, groups exhibited similar performance and <br>psychometric declines. At 24 h, repeat-sprint time had deteriorated by 4.1% for <br>PAS and 1.0% for CWT but was fully restored by COLD (0.0%). At 24 and 48 h, both <br>COLD and CWT attenuated changes in mean muscle soreness, with COLD (0.6 ± 0.6 <br>and 0.0 ± 0.4) more effective than CWT (1.9 ± 0.7 and 1.0 ± 0.7) and PAS having <br>minimal effect (5.5 ± 0.6 and 4.0 ± 0.5).

In this research, we evaluated hydrotherapy for <br>recovery from a simulated game of rugby union tracked over a week of training. <br>Twenty-four experienced male rugby union players (mean ± SD age 19.46 ± 0.82 <br>years, weight 82.38 ± 11.12 kg, height 178.54 ± 5.75 cm) were randomly divided <br>into 3 groups: cold water immersion (n = 8), contrast bath therapy (n = 8), and <br>a control group (n = 8). The 2 forms of hydrotherapy were administered <br>immediately after a simulated rugby game. Testing was conducted 1 hour before <br>the game and at 5 intervals postgame: 1, 48, 72, 96, and 144 hours. Dependent <br>variables included countermovement jump, 10- and 40-m sprints, sessional rating <br>of perceived exertion (RPE), flexibility, thigh circumference, and self-reported <br>delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Significant differences in DOMS were found <br>between the cold water immersion and contrast bath groups at 48 hours post <br>intervention (p = 0.02), and between the control and contrast bath groups at 72 <br>(p = 0.03) and 96 (p = 0.04) hours post intervention.

Nine participants underwent three <br>post-exercise recovery trials, including a control (CONT), mixed-method cooling <br>(MIX), and cold-water immersion (10 °C; CWI).

The ISE consisted of a 15-m <br>sprint every minute separated by self-paced bouts of hard running, jogging, and <br>walking for the remainder of the minute. Every sixth rotation, participants <br>performed 5 × 10-m runs, receiving a shoulder-led tackle to the lower body on <br>each effort. Sprint time and distance covered during ISE were recorded, with <br>voluntary (maximal voluntary contraction; MVC) and evoked neuromuscular function <br>(voluntary activation; VA), electromyogram (root mean square (RMS)), ratings of <br>perceived muscle soreness (MS), capillary and venous blood markers for <br>metabolites and muscle damage, respectively measured before and after exercise, <br>immediately after recovery, and 2 and 24 h after recovery.<br>RESULTS: Total distance covered during exercise was significantly greater in <br>CONT (P = 0.01), without differences between TPASS and TCWI (P > 0.05). TCWI <br>resulted in increased MVC, VA, and RMS immediately after recovery (P < 0.05). <br>M-wave amplitude and peak twitch were significantly increased after recovery and <br>2 h after recovery, respectively, in TCWI (P < 0.05).

The recovery intervention consisted of different water <br>immersion techniques, including: temperate water immersion (36°C; TWI), cold <br>water immersion (10°C; CWI), contrast water temperature (10-42°C; CWT) and a <br>passive recovery (PAS). Performances during a maximal 30-s rowing test (P(30 <br>s)), a maximal vertical counter-movement jump (CMJ) and a maximal isometric <br>voluntary contraction (MVC) of the knee extensor muscles were measured at rest <br>(Pre-exercise), immediately after the exercise (Post-exercise), 1 h after (Post <br>1 h) and 24 h later (Post 24 h). Leukocyte profile and venous blood markers of <br>muscle damage (creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)) were also <br>measured Pre-exercise, Post 1 h and Post 24 h. A significant time effect was <br>observed to indicate a reduction in performance (Pre-exercise vs. Post-exercise) <br>following the exercise bout in all conditions (P < 0.05). Indeed, at 1 h post <br>exercise, a significant improvement in MVC and P(30 s) was respectively observed <br>in the CWI and CWT groups compared to pre-exercise. Further, for the CWI group, <br>this result was associated with a comparative blunting of the rise in total <br>number of leucocytes at 1 h post and of plasma concentration of CK at 24 h post. <br>The results indicate that the practice of cold water immersion and contrast <br>water therapy are more effective immersion modalities to promote a faster acute <br>recovery of maximal anaerobic performances (MVC and 30″ all-out respectively) <br>after an intermittent exhaustive exercise. These results may be explained by the <br>suppression of plasma concentrations of markers of inflammation and damage, <br>suggesting reduced passive leakage from disrupted skeletal muscle, which may <br>result in the increase in force production during ensuing bouts of exercise.<br><br>DOI: 10.1007/s00421-010-1754-6<br>PMID: 21132438 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Twenty-two <br>healthy Division I collegiate soccer players (13 men and 9 women; age, 19.8 ± <br>1.1 years; height, 174.0 ± 9.0 cm; mass, 72.1 ± 9.1 kg) volunteered as <br>participants during the noncompetitive season.

Countermovement vertical jump (CMVJ) was used to assess <br>anaerobic power and was measured before YIRT, immediately post-YIRT, and 24 and <br>48 hours post-YIRT. A 10-cm horizontal visual analog scale was administered <br>immediately, 24 hours and 48 hours post-YIRT to assess perceived fatigue (PF) in <br>the legs.

Circulating <br>mediators of the inflammatory response were measured from EDTA plasma taken <br>pre-exercise (baseline), immediately post-exercise, and at 2, 24, and 48 h <br>post-exercise. Ratings of perceived soreness and impairment were noted on a <br>10-pt Likert scale, and squat jump and drop jump were performed at these time <br>points.<br>RESULTS: IL-6, IL-8, and MPO increased significantly from baseline immediately <br>post-exercise in all conditions.

The data obtained in this study <br>suggest that the response of the FC group to cooling vs the SC group response <br>was more likely an insulative-hypothermic response and that the SC vs the FC <br>group displayed a metabolic-insulative response.

However, <br>recent reports have cautioned that CWI may attenuate the adaptive response to <br>resistance training.<br>PURPOSE: To determine the effect of post resistance-exercise CWI on circulating <br>free testosterone (T) and cytokine (IL-6 and TNF-α) response.<br>METHODS: Using a randomized and counterbalanced repeated-measures design, 11 <br>resistance-trained men completed two workouts (6 sets of 10 repetitions of back <br>squats at 80% of maximum load) a week apart after which they took part in either <br>15 min of CWI (15 °C) or passive recovery. T, IL-6, and TNFα were measured in <br>blood samples taken before (PRE) and 5 (5POST), 15 (15POST), 30 (30POST), and 60 <br>(60POST) min post-exercise and compared between treatments and over time.<br>RESULTS: For T, a significant interaction effect of condition over time <br>(p = 0.030) as well as greater relative concentrations of T in CON (Δ9.2%) than <br>CWI (Δ-0.5%, p = 0.049) at 30POST were observed. In addition, at 60POST, T <br>dropped below PRE values in CWI (Δ-10.4%, p = 0.028) but not in CON (Δ-1.6%, <br>p = 0.850). A suppressed cytokine response was observed after CWI in IL-6 at <br>30POST (CWI: Δ4.9%, CON: Δ47.5%, p = 0.041) and TNFα at 15POST (CWI: Δ5.3%, CON: <br>Δ17.0%, p = 0.022).<br>CONCLUSIONS: CWI blunted the T and cytokine response after a bout of resistance <br>exercise.

A low body (cell) temperature or <br>the increase in the concentrations of the stress hormones cortisol, epinephrine, <br>and norepinephrine in response to acute cold stress have been proposed as potent <br>proinflammatory cytokine suppressant. In the current study, we tested the <br>hypothesis that the recovery of body temperature from a whole-body intermittent <br>cold-water immersion (CWI, at 13-14 °C for a total 170 min) is associated with a <br>delayed response of proinflammatory cytokines in young healthy men. Our results <br>revealed a delay in the increase in the proinflammatory interleukin 6 and <br>interleukin 1β cytokines after the CWI, which paralleled the changes in <br>cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and body temperature. CWI decreased tumor <br>necrosis factor α (TNF-α) immediately and 1 h after the CWI. Although TNF-α had <br>recovered to the pre-immersion level at 2 h after CWI, its natural circadian <br>cycle kinetics was disrupted until 12 h after the CWI. Furthermore, we showed <br>that CWI strongly modified the white blood cell counts, with changes reaching a <br>peak between 1 and 2 h after the CWI.<br><br>Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

EX comprised cycling for 15 min <br>at 75% peak power, then a 15-min maximal time trial. After each condition, a <br>full laboratory-based sleep study (polysomnography) was performed. Core and skin <br>temperature, heart rate, salivary melatonin, ratings of perceived fatigue, and <br>recovery were measured in each trial.<br>RESULTS: No differences were observed between conditions for any whole night <br>sleep measures, including total sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep onset <br>latency, rapid eye movement onset latency, wake after sleep onset, or proportion <br>of the night spent in different sleep stages. Core temperature in EX and CWI <br>trials was higher than CON, until it decreased below that of EX and CON until <br>bedtime in CWI. After bedtime, core temperature was similar for all conditions <br>throughout the night, except for a 90-min period where it was lower for CWI than <br>EX and CON (3.5-4.5 h postexercise). Heart rates for EX and CWI were both <br>significantly higher than CON postexercise until bedtime, whereas skin <br>temperature after CWI was significantly lower than EX and CON, remaining lower <br>than EX until 3 h postexercise. Melatonin levels and recovery ratings were <br>similar between conditions. Fatigue ratings were significantly elevated after <br>exercise in both CWI and EX conditions, with EX still being elevated compared <br>with CON at bedtime.<br>CONCLUSION: Whole night sleep architecture is not affected by evening exercise <br>alone or when followed by CWI.<br><br>DOI: 10.1249/MSS.0b013e318287f321<br>PMID: 23377833 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

However, few studies have compared the effect of <br>different cold modalities on nerve conduction parameters.<br>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of ice pack, ice <br>massage, and cold water immersion on the conduction parameters of the sural <br>(sensorial) and tibial motor nerves.<br>DESIGN: An experimental study was conducted in which the participants were <br>randomly assigned to 1 of 3 intervention groups (n=12 per group). Independent <br>variables were cold modality and pre- and post-cooling measurement time. <br>Dependent variables were skin temperature and nerve conduction parameters.<br>METHODS: Thirty-six people who were healthy, with a mean (SD) age of 20.5 (1.9) <br>years, participated in the study. Each group received 1 of the 3 cold <br>modalities, applied to the right calf region for 15 minutes. Skin temperature <br>and nerve conduction parameters were measured before and immediately after <br>cooling.<br>RESULTS: All 3 modalities reduced skin temperature (mean=18.2 degrees C). There <br>also was a reduction in amplitude and an increase in latency and duration of the <br>compound action potential. Ice massage, ice pack, and cold water immersion <br>reduced sensory nerve conduction velocity (NCV) by 20.4, 16.7, and 22.6 m/s and <br>motor NCV by 2.5, 2.1, and 8.3 m/s, respectively. Cold water immersion was the <br>most effective modality in changing nerve conduction parameters.<br>LIMITATIONS: The cooling area of the ice massage and ice pack was smaller than <br>that of the cold water immersion. The examiner was not blinded to the treatment <br>group. The population included only participants who were healthy and young.<br>CONCLUSIONS: All 3 modalities were effective in reducing skin temperature and <br>changing sensory conduction at a physiological level that is sufficient to <br>induce a hypoalgesic effect. The results suggest that cold water immersion, as <br>applied in this study, is the most indicated modality for inducing therapeutic <br>effects associated with the reduction of motor nerve conduction.<br><br>DOI: 10.2522/ptj.20090131<br>PMID: 20185615 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",
