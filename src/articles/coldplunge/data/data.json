Cold water led to clear effects like a big jump in metabolic rate and nervous system activity, but didn't raise the main 'stress hormone' cortisol. The study helps clarify how our bodies respond to cold water immersion, highlighting increased sympathetic nervous system activity but not a simple increase in stress hormones.",
